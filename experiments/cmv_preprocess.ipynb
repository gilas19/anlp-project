It fails to represent societies around the world in a fair manner over time, assumes men are always favored over women in all circumstances and doesn't acknowledge healthy relationships between a man and a woman exist in many different hues and styles. I also believe the concept destroys history, culture and any kind of context in an effort to view everything with a short-sighted lens.\\n\\nView:\\n\\nI think that patriarchy is dwarfed by oligarchy, defined above. Wealth is held by any person at any given point of time, and it is the wealthy who have the power to oppress those who don't have as much wealth. While this is a point counteracted with the argument that most CEOs in the western world are men, this is also short-sighted: It's not hard to see wealth doesn't have a prejudice towards women. Positions of power held by women and men have alike have been based around the accumulation of wealth and social clout. Whenever a woman came from a wealthy family or built her own wealth, power never escaped them because they were female. If we lived in a purely patriarchal society, the smashing success of Oprah Winfrey, Anna Maria Escobedo or Sonia Sotomayor wouldn't be possible. These are all women who built their own wealth, and I'd argue they jumped through as many hoops and obstacles as man in a similar or even identical situation. Looking back on history, wealthy women had a lot more privileges than men and women in lower classes of society. Even though Marie Antoinette's \\\"Let them eat cake.\\\" is a fake quote, it speaks to the vision of the French people of their higher classes as privileged people, disenfranchised from their woes. They even went so far as to execute her, not because she was a mother or a woman, but because she represented the crown they hated. \\n\\nIn my opinion, men aren't favored over women. Society simply favors the wealthy, whoever these people may be. As as society, we allow these people to be beacon and a finish line, a set of desirable traits that sets those who have far above those who haven't. These same people are the ones who get to make our laws (the 2013 US government shutdown), dictate our economy (AIG and the 2008 financial meltdown) and get to decide who thinks what (oligopoly of media). \\n\\nThe poor man will never be favoured over the rich woman. \\n\\nI want this view to be challenged.\",\n          \"&gt;  Do you mean factually wrong, morally wrong, or legally wrong?\\n\\nEspousing an indefensible position. So, whatever viewpoint you are trying to convince people of, whether it be moral, legal, or factual, cannot be backed up by whatever arguments that you have.\\n\\nI'm not talking about legal free speech here, necessarily, merely, when someone is pressed on their viewpoint, they fall back on \\\"I'm allowed to say this\\\" instead of backing up their viewpoint.\\n\\nSo, for example, your pro-war protesters (or the \\\"do nothing because maintaining the status quo is easy\\\" equivalent of protesters), tell the anti-war protesters to stop because they're wrong, and are wasting their time, and the anti-war protesters simply carry on, stating \\\"we're allowed to protest, we have a license\\\". Sure, they can continue protesting, but if they are arguing for their freedom of speech, that's an entirely separate argument, and says nothing for their opposition to war. If none of them were able to actually make an argument against war, they would probably be wrong in opposing it.\",\n          \"It's more like dressing up as a Nazi and expecting Jews to be okay with it. Historically Nazi garb = anti-semetic in the same way traditional black face = racist character.

Rather, they'd point out that a lot of social problems are shaped by patriarchy. For example, Wall Street is overwhelmingly male. This is because Wall Street strongly rewards competitiveness and risk-taking, which are attributes men are more likely to have. But this emphasis has led to some bad outcomes, and has exacerbated the problems of oligarchy that you mention. \\n\\nFeminist authors write mostly about gender issues for the same reason that scholars of religion or race write about those issues.

That doesn't make any sense to me. MLK is respected because of his message and his *ideas*, not because of the way he *dressed*, and certainly not because of his *skin color*. I've never once heard of anyone who thought that dressing up as an intellectual, particularly down to their skin color, was somehow necessary or beneficial to celebrating his/her accomplishments. This is a pretty poor example.\\n\\nFurthermore, even if it wasn't intrinsically racist, I can't think of a scenario where the benefits of Blackface would outweigh the detriments of offending a large group of people. As stated above, Blackface is not necessary to any celebratory reasons, so the only use I see for it is amusement (for Halloween or whatever). While amusement is not inherently racist, I do not believe that amusement is an excuse for offending a large group of people.
