We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made.

How are the things we create unnatural?\n\nWhile you are correct in this line of reasoning. Let me demonstrate how similar lines of reasoning could be used to render many words useless.\n\nHumans are made up of billions of cells, the cells are made up of some number of atoms, and to go further down atoms are made up of quarks (to vastly simplify things a bit). So then why call anything \"human\"? We should really refer to each other as collections of subatomic particles since that is what we really are.\n\nSo what I'm getting at here is the idea that all words - every single one - were invented by humans to explain some kind of phenomena or object. If you exclusively use your definition for natural, then is anything unnatural?\n\nImagine you're an archaeologist and you're at a site. You pick up an arrowhead from 100 BCE and you declare, \"I have found a natural rock!\" That might confuse your colleagues, especially if some of them are geologists.\n\nSo we use the word \"unnatural\" to differentiate between things made by humans and not made by humans in some contexts. Basically, both you and your friend are correct and it all depends on the context you're using these words in.",

We should really refer to each other as collections of subatomic particles since that is what we really are.\n\nBut that's not the same thing. Natural/unnatural is categorizing something. 'Human' basically is just a word that summarizes a certain combination of cells. You would need a definition of natural but there's really no good definition. e.g. for natural: 'existing in or derived from nature; not made or caused by humankind.' =&gt; that would mean that humans aren't natural, which implies that a god or aliens or something created us. It rejects evolution.\n'in accordance with the nature of, or circumstances surrounding, someone or something' =&gt; that makes no sense either, who defines what 'in accordance with nature' is?\n\n&gt; If you exclusively use your definition for natural, then is anything unnatural?\n\nAs I said, it implies an external influence, like god or aliens or something. Most people just use 'unnatural' as a synonym for 'something I disagree with' often in relation to a behavior that is bad for nature (e.g. 'destroying the rain forest is unnatural' but it isn't, it's probably a bad thing for several reasons but humans are selfish because that's the way evolution made us, so it's not unnatural, it's actually very natural).\n\nEDIT: wrote 'natural' instead of 'unnatural' in the last paragraph and changed it",

But the point of words is to express nuance. Some people have a reason to differentiate between things like rocks and things like ruins. My point is that if you're going to simply lump everything into the natural category and eschew the unnatural one then you could frankly just simplify everything in this way. \"Look at that collection of subatomic particles interacting with that other collection of subatomic particles!\"\n\nWords have subjective meanings, not objective ones. There are no words just floating out in space that tell humans how to interpret them. We invented them to describe the universe as we perceive it.

Natural comes from nature. \n\n&gt; Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural, physical, or material world or universe.\n\nIf someone say 'this is unnatural' it's the same as saying 'this is not from this universe'. But clearly things humans create are part of the universe/nature.\n\n&gt; You could frankly just simplify everything in this way.\n\nWhat? No, that makes no sense. I think you're confusing the word 'unnatural' with 'manmade'. \n\n&gt; \"Look at that collection of subatomic particles interacting with that other collection of subatomic particles!\"\n\nCan we please stop the bullshit about subatomic particles... this is a discussion about a logical mistake in the use of a word. I don't know where you get the absurd idea from that we can define anything anymore if we don't accept natural simply means 'everything'.\n\n&gt; We invented them to describe the universe as we perceive it. \n\nI don't think you know what nature means. \n\n&gt; Thus, some humans have deemed it necessary to draw a distinction between things created by humans and everything else.\n\nWTF!? There are already words for that e.g. manmade. Are you on drugs or something? Also where do you draw the distinction anyway? Is organic food unnatural?",

It's a number that is divisible only by itself and 1. \n\nThis is the usual definition given, but by this definition it could be argued that 1 is itself a prime number. After all, it's divisible by itself. And it's also divisible by 1. The two things it needs to be divisible by just happen to be the same thing. So for this reason, there's an additional restriction: 1 is not a prime number.\n\nWhy is that? It's a completely arbitrary restriction. We just threw on a clause at the end that stated 1 isn't prime. It should be prime! So why isn't it?\n\nBecause it's not useful. \n\nPrimes are useful because with them we can do things like construct *unique* prime factorization for example. The prime factorization of 12 is 2, 2, 3 because `2 * 2 * 3 = 12`. But if we allowed 1 to be prime, then we no long have unique prime factorization. We'd also have 1, 2, 2, 3, as well as 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and so on. This is just one example where limiting the definition of what a prime is can be useful. \n\nSo now back to the definition of 'natural'. Yes, the distinction between man made thing and natural things is arbitrary. But we make the distinction because it's useful for categorizing things. We didn't derive the definition from some set of core axioms. We arbitrarily added the clause \"Not made by humans\" so that we could distinguish between things made by people and things done without the influence of people. While we are, in a sense, not separate from nature, we are in a somewhat unique position relative to the rest of nature, so it makes sense to have language we can use to make that distinction.",

When an environmentalist says that unnatural toxins are damaging the environment, what she means is not necessarily just that toxins are artificial, but that by producing them we are somehow upsetting the course of the universe. Similarly, when a fundamentalist says that homosexuality is \"unnatural,\" he does not just mean that it is artificial in the sense of being created by society- he means that it is somehow wrong that this is a social artifact of humanity. \n\nI think what you mean to object to is \"natural\" in this sense of the word, which is perfectly reasonable.",

If the only way the product is created is in a laboratory, factory or anything resulting from human activity than it could be called \"unnatural\", or synthetic/man-made if you want to avoid the negative connotation of unnatural. Even though all transformations from the raw material to the final product must follow natural laws, it does not mean that the transformations would ever occur naturally, without human intervention. Sure you can expand the definition of natural to include these man-made products, but if you were to do that, the word natural loses its ability to describe things and differentiate between things we find and use and things we have to chemically alter or create. If this were the case you would need to describe things as \"not synthetically made\" to gain an edge over man-made products that are marketed as natural.\n\nI'll try to give an example without getting overly scientific but trans fats aren't natural, by this definition. To my knowledge trans fats rarely occur naturally, if ever. This is because when fats are formed, they arrange the elememts in a different orientation, known as cis. One way that the kther form, trans fats are formed is at high heats when the chemical bonds in the fat are broken and the alternative arrangement of bonds is formed in the trans arrangement. If i remeber correctly, one way trans fats are made is when oil is reused after frying. Obviously, no natural laws were broken when the trans fats were made so I guess you could call them natural. However this type of fat is never seen in nature, so when humans digest it, supposedly bad things happen. I think this is because it is in a form that our bodies have never seen before. For this reason I would argue that it's fair to call trans fats unnatural. If you want to change the word so it doesn't interfere with the idea that we are a part of nature call them man-made products or synthetic or something. But I feel as though in order to keep everyone informed about the food they are eating, and products they are buying, there has to be a distinction.\n\nI don't feel like all synthetic products are bad, for example polyester and polymers have changed the world, and continue to do so. Especially the ones that combine different chemicals that are never combined naturally to get the most desirable charecteristics from each separate natural chemical. There are a ton of great man-made products like teflon and other coatings. They just don't occur naturally.\n\nOne more point is that the view that everything is natural is often used to market products, many of the \"natural flavors\" in food are created synthetically. Although I'm not completely sure if the chemicals they make are found in nature, many of them probably do. But this raises another question, does it matter how we obtain the chemicals, or just if they are observed in nature when we use the word natural?",

I was fine; if she added essential oils I was sick.\n\nI wouldn't expect something so negative to be a placebo effect (I had either neutral or mildly positive expectations for essential oils). And the effect seemed repeatable and strong. So, I wouldn't say I've found essential oils to be helpful for anything (except making me feel sick) but on the principle that if a drug has a real effect on the body then it should also be able to have side-effects - something natural medicine enthusiasts seem to often ignore - I suppose this has made me more open to the possibility that they have genuine physiological effects.\n\nProbably worth pointing out though that none of my friends had this reaction!\n\nFrom an actual scientific evidence point of view there are at least a few cases where there are real studies to support e.g. tea tree oil having antiseptic properties, but maybe these cases are exceptions.",

There have been several studies performed over many years that have more or less proven this pretty well. I use it myself sometimes after laundering the bedclothes, putting a bit in the pillowcases. I used to foster a really crazy Yorkie, and a tiny dab of the oil on her paws made her unbelievably relaxed and calm.\n\nTea Tree Oil: This is good for minor infections and small wounds. It's endorsed by many doctors, and is even featured on WebMD for these uses (to a lesser extent a LOT of other healing things, but these haven't been studied well.) \n\nPeppermint Oil: While there aren't a lot of conclusive studies available for it, this shit is awesome for digestive issues in my experience when combined with other ingredients. The best medicine I ever had for digestive issues was infused with the stuff. Also, peppermint oil is AMAZING for deterring mosquitoes.\n\nAnyway, the stuff is useful, and typically smells awesome.

Now imagine that a few people in the audience begin returning fire.  Do you think that all of them are going to correctly identify the original shooter in the confusion?  Do you think that all of the 20% of people with guns in the building will correctly guess that there is only one hostile target?  Now shots are coming from every direction, and the 80% of the crowd without guns have no idea which way they should be running to get to safety.  They are running in every direction, unpredictably entering the line of fire of the people with guns.  Now think about what happens when the police arrive and have no idea who they should consider a threat and who is a friendly, yet need to make that distinction immediately or risk being shot themselves.  \n\nI think in many cases a confusing crossfire resulting in even more deaths is the only realistic outcome we can expect.  There will also be scenarios where all or most of the people in the area being attacked know each other well enough to recognize friend from foe, but in general these kinds of things happen in public places where people are strangers to one another.  In those situations the panic and confusion of adding more gunfire will usually make things worse.  Add in the fact that people are more likely to be killed by their own gun in either a home accident or a suicide than they are of using it to defend themselves and I don't see any reason to believe the proposed scenario would lead to a decrease in deaths.",

If you aren't looking at the shooter when the shooter opens fire, then the average civilian has very little chance of correctly responding to this situation instinctively.  A lot(I would guess a majority) of people are going to perceive anyone shooting in their direction at all as a threat.  Say the shooter enters at one end of the room and someone at the other end returns fire.  How are all of the people in between to know that the second guy is trying to hit the criminal and not them?  I know you said that you think these people should be trained, but how much training do you think is reasonable to expect before we give them a gun, especially if we want to get such a huge number of people armed?  To be able to respond in a situation like that requires constant training and practice, and it's not realistic to expect so many people to do that when they aren't police or military.  It's just not realistic to expect a full fifth of our population to be able to react like SWAT team members at the drop of a hat.",

People seem to think that we'll pull at the drop of a hat.  While there are undoubtedly a few a-holes among us that do, the *VAST* majority simply do not think that way.\n\nIn point of fact, *most* people who carry understand the weight of the tool at their disposal.  We understand that if we believe the situation warrants use of a gun then we've decided this is a life-or-death situation.  Thankfully, most average citizens, gun carriers or not, never encounter such situations.  Speaking for myself, I only have once in my life and it was more than 25 years now... and, I managed to survive it without a gun.  But when you do, the alternatives are facing it with a tool that we all know is effective at it's job, or going at it without that tool.  Even though I survived my one such case without a gun I wouldn't want to make the gamble a second time.\n\nNo, the truth is that most people who carry understand that carrying a gun makes you the pussy in the room.  It makes you the person that backs down from any and all confrontations long before they escalate to the point of needing a gun.  They understand that they are the ones that take the insults and just walk away.  We keep our anger in check at all times.\n\nWe're also the ones that are paying attention to our surroundings at all times, not burying our faces in our phones and whatnot, because we understand that situational awareness is the key to staying alive whether you have a gun or not.  We notice the little details.  We move to the other side of the street if we think we see trouble coming (whether it \"looks bad\" or not).  We're the ones that, more importantly, won't even *BE* on that street in the first place.\n\nLike I said, I'm sure you can find examples of people who carry who do so with the wrong mindset.  But if you spend any time around people who do carry you'll quickly realize those people are few and far between.  We're perfectly normal people, just like you, who just so happen to not want to be in a situation where we can't defend our lives.  Simple as that.",

Add in the fact that the situation would likely be even more stressful than the average SWAT raid since the civilians have no knowledge of any of the other participants and were completely unprepared in the moment, and do you still feel that training which would necessarily be brief and infrequent enough to allow for these people to have other jobs would be extensive enough to mitigate dangers I brought up?

I want to say most but that may not quite be accurate... there's no prohibition of carrying in most places (and, if memory serves, all states in the union now allow carry, though some so restrictive that they may as well not).  Schools, yes, banned in most places... but movie theaters?  Restaurants?  Malls?  The doctors' office?  For the most part, those of us that carry can and do carry in all those places every single day.\n\nFor example, in my state, there's no prohibition on those places.  What we do have is a situation where if a theater manager, as an example, sees me carrying... well, firstly it means I didn't do *my* job right because I carry *concealed* so if I'm made I blew it... but secondly, all that can happen is he can ask me to leave.  And being a law-abiding citizen, I will without incident because otherwise the police can be called and I'd be subject to criminal trespass charges.  What about signs that are posted saying no guns?  They carry no \"force of law\" here, which means while I can be asked to leave and definitely should, the law says I can be there with my gun.  This isn't an unusual setup, it's true in many states (again, it may even be most at this point).\n\nThe thing is, unless you live in one of the very anti-gun states (the NY, CA, NJ, CT, MA, MD's of the world) you've most likely been around people with guns many times and didn't even know it.  And notice you're still alive none the less! :)  Whether that (not you being alive, the other thing) makes you uncomfortable or not is up to you.  Personally, I *like* knowing others around me value their lives enough to defend them if the need arises.

I either avoid such things or solve them diplomatically.\n\nLet's say I have failed already. Well, then I suppose I would dissolve the situation to the best of my ability, ending it as fast as possible or with the least amount of harm to anyone. Would shooting someone be the fastest way? Yes, but it would likely also impart the most harm. Sure there are other ways of killing someone or maiming them without a gun but it is less likely then.\n\nYou must be wondering, then, what do I do if I am being threatened by someone with a gun? Since every situation is different, it's impossible to say. Getting into specifics doesn't really matter if it's with a gun or something else. One specific thing I guess I could say is that I feel like I would be in much higher danger if I had a gun.\n\nAvoiding danger and being safe is the only plan. Every situation is different.\n\nThis isn't such an easy issue, though. I can't just say \"don't get shot\" and be done with it. Unfortunately, the issue is festering and corrupt as it is. We train people to use guns to kill other people. It's one of the most philosophically ridiculous things to exist in our society. There are jobs out there that have the description of giving death to other things.\n\nBecause people can see guns as a way to kill other people, the fear will not fade. To not be afraid is to be blind to the issue.\n\nEventually people may not see guns as a way to kill other people (for whatever reason, please don't argue that this can't happen as that argument would be completely unrelated.) Then it won't matter if someone has a gun.\n\nNot in our lifetime!\n\nIn summary, it is best that the situation in which to defend myself never arises.",

On both occasions, she never even had to take the safety off. Just knowing a gun was present was enough to make the bad men go away. Most people who intend to do crime are lazy and aren't going to mess with someone who has a gun. They are going to go for the easy targets. Like gun-ban zones. I understand that there are crazy people who might just shoot up anywhere. But even a semi-rational criminal is more likely to go do crime where there is a much less likely-hood that they will be shot.\n\nI have taken all of the courses to legally carry my gun in my state. I also practice quite a bit with it and am quiet proficient. I have spoken and shot with many police officers in my area and I am as good, if not better, than they are with our respective weapons. Most people I know that carry their guns regularly are the same as me. We practice, we know what we are doing. I can't speak for everyone of course, I am simply stating what I have seen.

Assuming you live in America, violent crime has actually falling like a rock for the past couple of decades.

Many large cities ban concealed firearms regardless of our liberty to own weapons. Most work places ban guns from being on the premise.\n\nRecently there was the [2011 Tucson Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting). I lived right down the road from where it occurred and was involved with police and media due to the relationship of the shooter and the high school he attended. It was a wild minute as the shooter unloaded 33 rounds into the crowd. When he stopped to reload he was assaulted by a bystander with a chair.\n\nThat was in the state of Arizona which is as far conservative and gun toting as it can get. I know many people who pack as if its the wild west. However, these people never seem to be armed at the time of need.\n\nThe right to bear arms is simply gun ownership. In the event of civil war between the people and the government, the people are able to fight back. Where you are able to carry your gun is situational.\n\n[University of Texas Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman) was far more situational that would align with the OP's train of thought. A very long drawn out fire fight where police weren't equipped to deal with the gunmen. Citizens with hunting rifles fought back and kept the gunman pinned down as police entered the tower. This situation and a few others was the early starts of creating swat teams able to respond to armed gunman.\n\nFrance has gun laws allowing citizens to purchase hunting rifles with permits. In the event of something like that happening in the suburbs of France, citizens could respond. \n\nHowever, the situation is so unlikely to occur as shooters rarely take to a single place and shoot from in for such a long period of time. Most shootings happen in an instant and even armed citizens aren't aware of the situation as it is occurring. Police officers and hired guards are constantly in mental preparation of responding to such a situation and know they are expected to take deadly force when they see a lethal situation occurring. If I'm carry my gun all the time but I'm simply going to a super market to pick up groceries I will be reluctant to shoot till I've assessed what is occurring.\n\nAllowing concealed fire arms in a city like Paris to stop the threat of terrorists is a fruitless endeavor.",

They are a cowardly form of aggression. You can't take Karate classes to prevent from being blindly hit in the back of the head when walking down the street.\n\nThis is what has caused tribes, world powers and countries to invade others and root out there enemy rather than lie and wait to be attacked. \n\nI'm very pro-gun ownership. I find people who have 50 of them excessive. I think a shotgun in the home or a handgun in the car in a place accessible to you in the event of a break in or attack is a good protection. You wont miss an intruder in your home with a wide spread of a shotgun. Most intruders will turn and run at the sound of the shotgun cocking.\n\nThat is all you can protect personally with guns. \n\nImagining yourself fending off a gunman in a crowded theater is ultimately a dream. If you carry a gun with an 8 to 9 round magazine you better be a damn good shot because crazed gunmen usually come with automatic weapons or weapons with extended magazines and it may not be there only weapon. \n\nIf half the citizens carried in public places MP5's with 30 round clips you may be able stop a few random encounters over the years but then again you'd have citizens turning into militants.",

Those time periods/places did not enjoy lower rates of violent death. \n\nConsider the \"wild west.\" Obviously it wasn't nearly as full of gun battles as the movies make it seem, but according [this study] (http://cjrc.osu.edu/homicide-rates-american-west-randolph-roth) the murder rate was \"extraordinarily high by today's standard.\" \n\nLooking at the rest of the thread, I think I see what might be a flaw in our collective logic. The incidents that stand out most in our heads are events like Paris or Aurora or Columbine- premeditated shootings with the intent of inflicting a lot of casualties. If the staff at Charlie Hebdo or Columbine High had guns, they certainly might have been able to end these incidents earlier. They also might have inflicted more casualties with stray bullets. These types of hypothetical calculations aren't really helpful, in my opinion.\n\nBut lets assume that more guns makes mass shootings less likely. Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one?\n\nI don't think it would, because though premeditated murders could well be less likely, accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase. \n\nThis study found that owning a gun makes one more likely to die from suicide *and* homicide. Of course, that's correlation, so there might be some third factor at play that makes gun owners more likely to b targets of crime or clinically depressed, but it certainly suggests that owning a gun doesn't automatically make you safer.\nhttp://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full\n \nWhether or not more guns would prevent events like today's isn't the issue (though I am inclined to say they wouldn't necessarily do that), it seems like a greater proliferation of weapons would be more dangerous for a number of other reasons.",

I'm sure with the right culture it would, but maintaining a culture is hard. Like I said the role of these people would be to defend themselves and those around them. It wouldn't help deterring suicide attacks, and would most probably cause few more deaths from mistakes and irresponsibility, with a danger of this worsening. In cases of mass shootings like you outlined, which are the situations I am thinking of, it would perhaps be best that these people wouldn't be armed with a gun but a paralyzer (taser), so when they find a safe hiding place or cover they have a chance getting themselves in a position where they can use the paralyzer on the attacker. This would have most of the benefits as with what I imagined with guns except it might be less probable to work against well prepared attackers (against heavy clothing), but on the other hand it could also deter from suicide attacks as they usually count on not being caught alive and of course it always is best for the attacker to be brought to justice in court.\n\nAlthough you haven't suggested this, your post lead my thoughts to it, so have a delta for that:\n\n&amp;#8710;\n\nPS: Re the study, well of course it doesn't suggest that.

Not getting the money is not an option because you're desperate.\n\nIf one in 10,000 people are carrying firearms, do you take your chances and try to get someone to hand over their cash without shooting someone or do you kill them outright and steal their valuables off their corpse?\n\nHow does that decision change when the odds are 1 in 5?\n\nRemember, you're an addict and not getting the money is not an option.\n\n\nScenario 2:\n\nYou're carrying and you rear end a guy.

    "title": "CMV: Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim, and it's a worthwhile endeavor.",
    "op_text": "I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:\n1) Explaining causation is not \"blaming\" the victim.\n2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nI'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)\n\nLet me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.\n\nOn the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)\n\nThe case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.\n\nFinally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. \n\nI understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a sentence.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a \"worthwhile endeavor\" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and \"explaining causation\" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. \n\nAs far as \"part 1\" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term \"causation\" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that \"avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged\", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that \"explaining causation is not victim blaming\", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think \"explaining causation\" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. \n\nAt any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

            "text": "\"Causation\" is a very deep, complex topic, and when people who are \"explaining causation\" are accused of victim blaming, it's usually because they've taken an approach to causation which is unhelpful, oversimplified, or which misses the important points.\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical violent crime and ask, \"why did this happen?\" it's tempting to think we can boil this question down to one or two or three \"main\" causes. Let's say:\n\n1) Jamie was a habitual violent criminal  \n2) Jamie happened to be in Central Park looking for victims  \n3) Pat chose to walk through Central Park that night  \n4) Pat was unarmed, listening to headphones and not cultivating a lot of situational awareness  \n\nNow, which of these causes is the *real* reason for the assault? What would it even *mean* to say that one of these is a more real, or more important, cause than the others? It seems to me that, as \"cause and effect\" are popularly conceived, we want to be able to set up one-to-one relationships between effects and causes, as if history were some sort of sequential chain.\n\nIn reality, every single one of these conditions is a necessary condition for this assault to take place. If you removed any single one of these \"causes\", the encounter would have happened differently, or not at all. There isn't a \"chain\" of preceding causes for a given event, there's an infinitely branching family tree of causal ancestors.\n\nAnd in addition to these four causes, there are countless others which we didn't have time to list, such as:\n\n5) there were no police officers in visual range at the moment when Jamie and Pat crossed paths  \n6) Jamie didn't sprain an ankle going downstairs for breakfast that morning  \n7) Pat wasn't struck by a meteorite on the way to the park  \n8) A butterfly flapped its wings a few weeks ago\n\nSo none of this is news, and I think we're all pretty familiar with the idea that the future is a great big mess of intersecting and mutually-interfering causes, effects, and conditions, which can only be navigated probabilistically and heuristically. Our decisions about *which* causes and effects to focus on, in order to bring about the sorts of outcomes we want, must be motivated accordingly. The question which matters is not \"do victims ever *cause* their own victimization?\", because the answer to that is trivially yes. I can avoid car accidents by staying in bed all day every day, and in that sense, I am the \"cause\" of anything which *ever* happens to me, by virtue of the fact that I chose to get up and get dressed that day.\n\nThe more meaningful question to ask, is \"whose behaviour can be changed, and how, in order to optimize expected outcomes?\" I could easily avoid car accidents if nothing else mattered to me, but I have places to go and people to see so I make compromises, cross streets, and even jaywalk sometimes for my own convenience. None of this is reason to conclude that I don't know cars are dangerous.\n\nThe people who get accused of victim-blaming, IMHO, have usually failed to consider or address this second question in any meaningful or novel way - and the fact that they bother to express their thoughts on the topic *at all*, usually carries with it an implicit (and very condescending) assumption that the recipient of their 'helpful advice', the person actually *facing* the risk, hasn't already given the question any deep consideration of their own. Women are *well aware* that there are rapists out there. Black people are *painfully cognizant* of the fact that police departments have a racism problem. If anyone is acting, to your eye, as if they didn't know this was the case, the misunderstanding is almost certainly on your end.\n\nThere is nobody out there saying \"Oh wow! I never realized I could make myself safer by voluntarily refraining from some of the fun, risky behaviours which other people engage in!\" Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety *when they were supposed to have both*. When something bad happens, there will *always, always always* be someone around to say \"well you could have made yourself 5% less likely to be targeted by doing X\", and the only way to *not* receive this kind of useless advice from someone, would be to stay home all day every day. And if you die unscathed, poor and lonely after a lifetime of playing it safe, *even then*, there will be others who advise you to \"live a little!\" and observe that you could have created a better life for yourself by taking more risks.\n\nIt's not \"victim blaming\" to observe that victims have opportunities to reduce the risks they face, but it's condescending to imagine that you have better insights into how to do this than they do, or to assume that the reason they don't is that they just didn't know they could.",

Pat knew the park was dangerous at night (disclaimer: i've never actually been to Central Park, I don't know if it's dangerous at night), yet chose to go anyway, and chose to be unobservant. Those are conscious choices made in the face of known circumstances.\n\nThe rest, however, are not choices by those involved. Butterflies, meteors, sprained ankles, those weren't really choices. Jamie probably didn't *choose* not to sprain an ankle, and Pat probably didn't *choose* to avoid a meteor. The only possible \"choice\" in the list is the lack of police presence, which is actually one \"cause\" that's commonly listed.\n\n&gt;When something bad happens, there will always, always always be someone around to say \"well you could have made yourself 5% less likely to be targeted by doing X\", and the only way to not receive this kind of useless advice from someone, would be to stay home all day every day\n\nThat's taking things to an illogical extreme. When people try to determine causes of an event, they're not saying \"you should just never do anything.\" They're singling out pointlessly risky behavior - like jaywalking in a busy street, or walking through a bad area, or getting drunk with strangers. Those things don't have much of a chance of making your life better, but *do* have a big chance of making it much worse (or ending it).\n\n&gt;The more meaningful question to ask, is \"whose behaviour can be changed, and how, in order to optimize expected outcomes?\"\n\nThis *is* what people are doing, when they look for causality. They want to understand why this thing happened, so that victims don't pile up. Usually when a crime is committed, it's assumed the aggressor is beyond good sense in the first place. Otherwise they wouldn't likely be committing crimes. But we *can* help potential victims by advising them not to put themselves at needless risk.

If we're going to get hardassed about how that word is defined, then we're back to the ol' \"stay at home forever\" scenario. But if you're willing to soften the definition of \"need\" such that it includes things like \"i *need* to have a satisfying social, sexual and recreational life\" then you have a where-to-draw-the-line problem. How much fun is enough? How much risk is too much? What's the best compromise to choose between safety and excitement?\n\nAnyone presuming to answer that question on someone else's behalf, is making some very uncharitable presumptions about that person's ability to evaluate risk. They ought to make *damn* sure they're actually telling them something they don't already know, and the vast vast majority of people offering safety advice, aren't.\n\nAt the very least, such people are saying \"You would be better off if you had X% less risk of being victimized and Y% fewer opportunities for spontaneous, free-wheeling fun in your life\". But the optimal tradeoff ratio between X and Y is a completely personal, completely subjective question which depends on *what people want out of life*.

The aggressor is still the one to be \"blamed\", in the sense that they are the only ones that ought to be punished. But fault should be attributed to anyone who made choices that knowingly put the victim in danger (including the victim themselves). Fault lies with the victim who put themselves in a needlessly risky situation, and with authorities/officials/parents/whomever who let that area get dangerous in the first place. It just so happens that *that particular victim* made choices that led to a dramatically increased risk of victimhood. Pat could have *not* gone through the park, and stuck with a route that was known to be safer.\n\n&gt;Getting drunk with strangers, particularly if you're of a physically weaker or more sexually sought-after gender or body type(Sorry mods!!!) is dangerous. Everyone knows this. No one is served by reminding anyone of it, least of all the vulnerable people doing it. They know. People do it anyway because it's fun.\n\nI mentioned this in other comments, but that doesn't seem to be true. There are a good set of people who believe anything bad that happens to them cannot be attributable, in any part, to their actions. People who say things like \"don't teach people not to leave valuables in their car, teach thieves not to steal them\". Ideally, *nobody* would steal. But the nature of crime is a much harder (some would say an impossible) problem to solve than teaching people how to take precautions to prevent themselves becoming a victim.\n\n&gt;At the very least, such people are saying \"You would be better off if you had X% less risk of being victimized and Y% fewer opportunities for spontaneous, free-wheeling fun in your life\"\n\nAlso not useful. Taking precautions to reduce your risk of victimhood doesn't mean living a boring life. It means not intentionally doing things that are likely to make you a victim; like jaywalking a busy street, walking through a shady park at night, or leaving valuables in your car. Maybe you really love taking risks - fine. That's your bad decision to make. But it's very possible that a victim didn't even know they were making bad decisions (Maybe Pat is like me, and didn't realize the park was dangerous). It's a worthwhile endeavor to *inform them* about it, and give advice on how to avoid being a victim in the future. It doesn't mean they need to take the advice (they can be a victim as many times as they want), but what's ethically wrong from trying to help people avoid victimhood?",

[people with something *actually novel* to share, like some little-known pressure point or grappling technique, rarely elicit much hostility.]\n\nIf I want to take gratuitous risks (insofar as it's anyone's place but mine to determine what \"gratuitous\" means), as you generously gave me permission to do above, then how should I go about living my deliberately-chosen risky lifestyle *without* enduring a bunch of well-meaning harassment from people who can't fathom someone actually wanting to enjoy getting drunk with strangers, and who assume I just don't know what risk is?\n\nIf you see me jaywalking at a time and place where you would wait for a crosswalk light, is it reasonable to try and educate me about the fact that cars are dangerous?

When someone interrupts your dinner to tell you about a phone company promotional offer, the aforementioned 2 assumptions are both at play: the advertiser is expressing an implicit assumption that you *didn't know* you could get unlimited domestic calling for only $8.95 a month,  which is probably a fair assumption if the promotion is new and insufficiently publicized, but also they're expressing an implicit assumption that *knowing about this deal would change your decision in any way,* and furthermore that *this knowledge(and the opportunity to act on it) is worth more to you than an uninterrupted dinner*.\n\nThis 2) thing, is an assumption about your priorities, about how much you value your time and money, and about what other long-distance options you have at your disposal.

This I think we agree on. However, a significant number are mutual to some degree, or in part aided by poor decisions and/or driving ability on the part of the accepted victim. That they are not deemed at fault for the collision doesn't change that.\n\nIn my admittedly limited experience, very few people are both skilled drivers and consistent practitioners of defensive driving. How many people consistently scan all of their mirrors, especially when stopped, or maintain both a safe speed and adequate following distance? Never look away from the road in front for more than 2-3 seconds at a time? Leave a gap when pulling up to an intersection to aid in escaping being rear-ended? Scan every intersection before entering? Attempt to maintain a staggered formation when driving on the highway? Never drive when fatigued, unwell, or otherwise unable to focus fully on the road?\n\n&gt;Most of the time they're aware of the risk, and they have been forced into a dilemma of choosing some compromise between freedom and safety when they were supposed to have both.\n\nI think one of the more crucial points of debate is whether or not their framing and evaluation of that decision is relevant or a valid target for criticism. I agree that many, even most cases are reflexive or ideologically motivated and can be fairly described as victim blaming, but the current trend is very much to tar *any* questioning of a victim's decisions with that brush. It may be good for the victim (I don't think it invariably is, but that's another debate) but it does a serious disservice to their agency.",

I'll focus on two:\n\nFirstly, what does it mean *to Pat* to talk about whether or not Jamie's behaviour \"can be changed\"? From *Pat's* perspective, Pat has something to lose, and some hypothetical Jamie has something to gain. It's not in Jamie's interest to change behaviour, and it's not within Pat's capabilities to change Jamie's behaviour.\n\nSecondly, if you're talking about optimisation, you shouldn't just be trying to optimise the expected outcomes. You should be trying to optimise *the trade-off between expected benefit and expected cost*. There are plenty of ways to get a good outcome (e.g. carry a gun and kill Jamie, or hire a permanent troop of bodyguards) that simply have prohibitively high costs. The costs of reforming Jamie are pretty high (Jamie would need to be arrested, spend time in prison / rehabilitation, etc. none of which Pat really has any control over) for pretty low expected payoff for Pat (what proportion of habitual violent criminals reoffend after prison?), whereas the cost for Pat to change behaviour are pretty low (take a different route, pay attention to surroundings) for an expected payoff that is very high to Pat (not becoming the victim of a violent crime). If Pat is thinking about optimisation, the choice is obvious.\n\n&gt; some compromise between freedom and safety\n\n\"Freedom\" is a really strange term here. Does anyone really believe that they have the *freedom* to be safe?\n\n&gt; it's condescending ... to assume that the reason they don't [reduce the risks they face] is that they just didn't know they could.\n\nNo, but it's not condescending to assume the reason they don't is often because they simply don't consider it, or misjudge the danger. Many people subconsciously assume the chances that they will be attacked while alone in a park at night to be *so* low that they will fail to take even the most trivial, low-cost precautions such as being vigilant and not wearing headphones. This is a false assumption (proved time and time again by statistics like \"1 out of every 4 women will get raped\"). Saying \"you should have been vigilant and not worn headphones!\" is too little too late after an attack, but the speaker is undeniably *right* from the point of view of cost-benefit analysis.",

My last paragraph was a poorly-worded illustration, admittedly. Even if it's \"1 in 20\" (which I understand to be a pretty average estimate, though figures vary hugely of course), it's (probably) a bigger risk than you would like to run for the very small gain of being able to listen to music and zone out on your way home.\n\nOf course, similar arguments apply to \"a friend's house during a party\": paying attention to your drinks, for instance, is always very low-cost but sometimes high-benefit. Similar arguments apply to a lot of things: a friend of mine had his bicycle stolen, which is a pretty big loss when weighed against the low-cost advice \"don't leave it unguarded and unlocked in plain sight in a public area for long periods of time\" that he failed to heed. My point is simply that, in any situation in which anyone makes any kind of choice, it's reasonable to ask the question \"do the costs outweigh the benefits?\".

Let's take your example: \n\n&gt;The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged.\n\nActually, it would have also prevented your being mugged had you left 10 minutes later. It further likely would have prevented your mugging had one of you been armed. If the mugger's spouse had a fight with them before they left the house to mug you, and this delayed them so you passed before they did, it would have prevented your mugging. \n\nYour being mugged is a *statistical* outcome, not attributable to any one behavior on your part. In this case, the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you. There's no other causal factor that would have actually *prevented* the situation, only changed the probabilities, and you can't really trust probabilities to guide specific behavior in specific situations. \n\nAbsolute \"causation\" isn't a helpful concept in cases like this. The causal factors of one individual trial of a statistical experiment aren't very important. The response to a statistical problem is not to change behavior on individual trials of the experiment, it's to address the root cause of the statistical problem. \n\nWe can't, nor should we, do everything in our power to reduce all possibility of danger. Surely you can see the reductio ad absurdum here. \n\nWe have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let's convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you \"should\" not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged.\n\nIt's not necessarily \"wrong\" to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that's your real goal. It's not too helpful, because people don't really have enough information, nor training in statistical theory, to apply that information. \n\nBut it's really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because it's \"obvious to you\" that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. \n\nIf you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a 0.01% chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change (let's say the average is $100, with another $900 in lost peace of mind), by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is $0.10, so that they can decide if it's worth that cost to them.\n\nAnd that's about accurate for the most dangerous parts of any town, and for actual losses typically incurred. If you exaggerate the danger, you're not doing anyone any favors, and are actually doing them harm, statistically.\n\nWhen you talk to an actual *victim* about these things, realize that they *already* probably have a vastly inflated opinion about the risks of their behavior, because they have suffered an unlikely outcome in that regard. \n\nAlmost in every case, if you're speaking to a *victim*, it would be more accurate to *downplay* the risks that they took, if your goal is to actually statistically help them. \n\nIf someone is in a plane crash and is injured, your telling them that riding planes is dangerous is true as far as it goes... it's just a lot less dangerous than driving, which is what they're likely to do instead. \n\nSocietally speaking, we have to be very careful what we warn people about, because everyone's mileage varies.",

Yes, everything is a statistical outcome, from walking down the street, to playing russian roulette with only one chamber empty.  That trivial observation does not somehow remove our ability to talk about causation though, because the statistics *inform* intelligent decisions generally.  The statistic that I have a 5 in 6 chance of losing that russian roulette game is what makes playing so stupid.  \n\nSo it would seem that your reply is really only making the point that times when it's appropriate are limited to when the risk is sufficiently high, which is agreeable enough, but that doesn't somehow lead to the conclusion that you can *never* criticize victims for what they did, which it seems would have to be the conclusion to really be at odds with the OP.",

I still think \"explaining causation\" is not the same as \"justifying an outcome\", but I do think it's important to take into account the context / situation. As you say, there are certain cases in which explaining causation doesn't really do anything. In fact, as other users have pointed out, it can lead to increased guilt on the part of victims - particularly in sexual assault - even if that was not your intention.\n\nEDIT: Also, your points about causation being a complex thing (which you make elsewhere as well) are good and I agree with them, but as others have said, I don't think they detract from the main point. The term \"causation\" was probably too ambiguous to have used, but I didn't want to go into statistical accounts of an outcome. The point remains that all of us take certain precautions to decrease the chance of certain outcomes.",

Giving them an \"Don't you know this is dangerous!?\" message after the fact doesn't do anything but make them feel worse about their decision.\n\nHow about a real example of this in action:\n\nMy car was broken into a couple weeks ago. It was in a secure garage, and I live in a relatively decent area. It's still dense and urban, though, so property crime is higher than the suburb cities that I could have lived in. I also left an Ikea box in my car. It was broken into, and the box stolen.\n\nHere is advice that I got:\n\n1. Don't live in the urban area, move back to the burbs (completely true, the property crime rate in the burb I used to live in was dramatically lower than where I live now).\n2. Don't leave valuables in the car (I hadn't considered a box valuable, but I understand a bit more of the mindset of someone who does this, now).\n3. Always identify and park near cameras. Shit, I'd never thought of that! I really hadn't. And I wouldn't have thought of it, unless someone told me.\n\nNow; I was at least partially at fault for moving to the more dangerous area, leaving things in my car, and not parking it in a safer part of the garage. The thief is still to blame for his actions, but *my* actions could have made this less likely to happen. In fact I probably could have avoided the thing entirely by not leaving the box in the car. That's my bad, and in the future i'll avoid victimhood by not doing that.\n\nWhat's so ethically wrong with advising people on how to improve their odds?

It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nThis paragraph makes a couple of assumptions involving how our culture views \"cause\" and responsibility.  From a deterministic point of view, where you still have the freedom to choose where you go but everything else is predetermined, you entering a bad area is the \"cause\" of your mugging.  But that doesn't make you responsible for being mugged, because every individual is, legally, recognized as having the same freedom of choice that you have.  So the mugger chose to mug you.  That choice was the \"cause,\" not your decision to enter an unsafe area.\n\nYou increasing your chance of being mugged didn't actually cause your mugging.\n\nMaybe this is just pedantic, because ultimately there is a correlation between entering that area and getting mugged.  However, problems arise when people think they know how certain things correlate when they actually don't.  Humans are actually quite bad at probabilities and intuitively understanding them.  So it then becomes a problem when people think \"i'm not blaming the victim, I'm recognizing a correlation,\" because they don't usually have a good reason to believe that they are really recognizing a correlation.\n\nA great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing.  First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.  But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing.

Why do you assume there's only one cause? That's a naive view. Had someone else walked in, instead of him, that person would be mugged instead. Which means that the original crime was avoided. If no one walked in, no one would be mugged.\n\nWhich means that one of the causes is *definitely* the person who walks in. No matter how you look at it. No second person, no crime.\n\nThe inflictor is definitely the one to 'blame', however. As we wouldn't want to throw random people into jail simply for being a part of a mugging.\n\nEither way, both the inflictor and victim were the cause. Just as the guy who sold the inflictor a knife/gun was the cause.\n\n&gt;A great example of that problem is when the cause of a rape is correlated with what the victim was wearing. First, culturally, the rapist is to blame, just like the mugger above, regardless of mitigating circumstances.\n\nCorrect. The rapist is the inflictor in this case. Had they not been there, the rape would not have occurred (or done by someone else). That said, the victim can certainly do things to lower the chance that someone will rape them. Such as not become drunk in a bar. Certainly that would drastically reduce the chance they'd get raped.\n\nThough honestly, I don't think clothes have much to do with it. But being situationally aware certainly does.\n\n&gt; But second, there isn't actually a correlation between the chances a person will get raped and the clothes they are wearing. People erroneously think that there is a correlation because it \"makes sense\" and they fall victim to confirmation bias.\n\nWell you have to understand why the inflictor is doing such things. Just like the mugger. They aren't doing it to 'be a mugger'. The mugger most likely needs money. So he mugs people for it. Don't have anything on you, and the mugger won't/can't take anything. Results muted. The rapist (from what I understand) wants sexually related power. It's not so much the clothes. In this case, avoid drinks from strangers, be sure to stay mostly sober. And don't uncautiously enter unfamiliar bars.\n\nThe victim is the victim because of their choices. And the victim is half the reason the crime is able to take place.\n\nEdit: It's not like the mugger has it out for OP and will hunt him down. He just mugged the first guy he ran across. Which means OP can definitely make sure it's not him.",

The point is to get something from someone, particularly of value. In this case, if you remove those possibilities, the mugging can't and won't happen. Put a cop in sketchy areas. This prevents the problem. Avoid sketchy areas. Again, prevents the problem. Which one can the average person do?\n\nAs the average citizen, you can't fix 10,000 nameless unknown criminals.

In a group of sober, non-addicted people, there's pretty much 0 problems. Look at an office or university. If you want to avoid problems, risk-assesment tells you should stick to those areas if you want to be safe.\n\nAs for what specifically leads up to rape/intrusions/muggings/etc, we aren't 100% sure. Which is why it's good to spread info on what does. So we can avoid those situations while the problematic people are apprehended and helped.\n\nIf someone's a loon, there's a good chance you should avoid them. As they aren't straight in the mind and might cause problems. If you go up anyway, and get mugged, that's your damn fault.

Telling them \"Don't you know not to go into bad neighborhoods?\" after the fact is demeaning and unnecessary. \n\nTrue. But saying \"X is a bad neighborhood, didn't you know?\" is more specific.

X-street has a lot of muggings. Yes, you got mugged there, which adds another data point. Though had I not told you this info, you might assume the mugging wasn't connected to X-street and continue to travel along there. Now you know it was because you walked along X-street, and can avoid it in the future.\n\nYou are assuming people have perfect knowledge. And in many cases they don't. At all. Which is why they got into the situation in the first place.\n\nEither way, the overall point is to discuss *all* of the causes, and how to minimize them.

And many gun control arguments use this. \"More restrictions on who can own a gun means less gun deaths\". Rather than put the focus on the criminal (or the misuser) they put it on the distributors of guns.\n\nNaturally, more checks might reduce problematic ownership. But perhaps not.\n\nAs far as the victim being part of the cause, there's definitely some fixes, at least from their perspective. You can lower those incidents by avoiding situations in which they occur. Don't hang around guns, and your chance of getting shot lowers. Be a gun lover and it raises. It's not that you'd intentionally shoot yourself, but rather pure probability. Being around guns increases the chance you'll be shot. If you are okay with that, then hang around guns. If not, then don't. That's fully within a person's ability.\n\nThe knife salesman could realize his knifes are used as weapons, and make them not as sharp. or perhaps switch to selling butter knives. Or maybe not sell to sketchy people.\n\n&gt;So the sun, earth, and moon are also causes. But in what way is that significant?\n\nRight. Environment can definitely be a part. Say a terrorist hijacks a plane and flies into a storm with the intention of crashing. Had you not flown when there was a storm, that couldn't have happened. No storm, no storm to crash into.\n\nThe point is that they are still causes and factors. Using this, the victim can be alerted of these, and perhaps make better decisions if they don't want to be mugged.\n\nJust like it's useful to know car crashes are one of the leading causes of death. People will still ignore it, but perhaps drive more safely. Or maybe avoid cars all together and take the subway.\n\n&gt;Are you really that much more likely to be mugged on the wrong side of the tracks?\n\nIt's hard to say without a specific incident. Generally this stuff is encapsulated by \"common sense\", but \"common sense\" is not something some people have. Other times it might be misguided (like slutty clothing causing rapes).\n\n&gt; Really, does anyone have a statistic on this? \n\nNot for \"being in dark alleys is bad\". But perhaps \"X street has a lot of gun shootings, avoid there\". Particularly look at San Francisco. Practically every other street has a clear level of criminal activity. You avoid the 'bad' streets, and walk along the good ones. You can certainly walk along the bad streets and be fine. But there's simply a higher chance of, say, getting your backpack snagged while walking on certain streets. You can look at crime maps. It's pretty clear where most of the crimes occur, and where is safe.\n\nAlso knowing that there's a lot of car break ins might make you wary of owning a car (or keeping anything valuable in it). This information helps inform decision making.\n\n&gt;because the victim has no control over where the mugger/rapist is, so his or her choice to walk down a street is not really a meaningful factor.\n\nThis may be true if there's no significant data for individual streets/areas. But it works on a general scale too. Living in a city with more crime means there's a higher chance of you being involved. If you live in a place with little to no crime, that chance reduces dramatically.\n\nIt's still a factor, and one that may or may not be able to be controlled, depending on the situation.",

That's stupid, she should have known she would get mugged.\"\n\nThe correct response is: \"Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime.",

In fact, I think s/he made it pretty clear that s/he was against that type of response, as it is clearly unproductive and inappropriate.\n\nSecondly, I don't think that this response:\n\n&gt;\"Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nactually addresses the issue we're discussing. IMO, OP's point was more that while we should not simply blame the victim and leave it at that, everyone should reasonably be expected to be aware of the potentially risky situations that exist in the world, and take some personal responsibility for their own safety in the face of an unjust world. To draw an absurd example, if I'm walking home from work one night and get mugged, that's not my fault. But if I'm getting mugged on the same block every night and I keep walking home that way without taking any extra security precautions to avoid a dangerous situation that I am fully aware of, it is unreasonably idealistic and naive to say that I am still in no way responsible for the outcome of those actions. One could even extend the example further: if I knowingly go walking through a well-known shitty ghetto full of crackheads and murderers at 4 a.m. wearing a jacket made out of $100 bills and I get robbed, is that in no way my own responsibility? Of course the act of the crime is purely the fault of the criminal, but at the same time it is my individual responsibility to look out for my own safety, in the knowledge that shitty people often do shitty things.\n\nI agree that it's a very fine line to walk between the ideas of victim blaming and personal responsibility, and I'll be the first to admit that I don't know exactly where that line should be drawn, but I absolutely agree with OP in that this is a conversation that needs to be had in the general public.",

                        "text": "In principle, the line isn't that difficult to draw - the distinction is between causation and fault.\n\nVictim-blaming is when you fault the victim for their misfortune: e.g. \"Mary was reckless and is thus morally blameworthy for her attack.\"\n\nIt's not vicitm-blaming when you blamelessly attribute causation to behaviour: e.g. \"Mary would not have been attacked but-for the route she took.\" That said, it's still insensitive: why are we talking about causation ex-post facto? What are we analyzing if not the attribution of blame? You'd better have a damned-good teaching moment planned otherwise you're just doing intellectual masturbation instead of sympathizing and it is *not appreciated*. \n\nWhere it gets tricky is that causation and fault have lots of different standards, are easy to confuse, and if you're not careful it's very easy to  accidentally imply or have others infer fault, even when you only intend to speak to causation.\n\nStandards of causation:\n\n* Probabalistic: Mary increased the odds she would be attacked\n\n* But-for: Mary would not have been attacked but-for her action (i.e. her action was necessary for the attack to have occured)\n\n* [And many others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#Theories)\n\nStandards of fault:\n\n* Absolute liability: it's your fault because you were responsible for it not happening, and it happened anyway.\n\n* Strict liability: it's your fault because you were responsible for it not happening, you did not do your due diligence to prevent it from happening, and it happened.\n\n* Neglience: it's your fault because you had to take reasonable care of the situation, you failed to reasonably take care, and that failure caused it to happen.\n\n* Recklessness: it's your fault because you wantonly disregarded the risks of it happening, and it happened.\n\n* Intent: it's your fault because you tried to make it happen and it happened.\n\nSo if people are harsh in their standards of fault, any assertion of causation automatically becomes an assertion of fault (e.g. I think Mary is at-fault if she was negligent; you are saying that she didn't take reasonable care and that if she had she would have been safe; therefore you're asserting facts that would make her at-fault according to my fault standards, therefore you're blaming Mary).\n\nSo if you want to talk about causation without implying fault, you need to be explicitly generous in your fault standards: e.g. \"Nobody is expected to act perfectly safely, taking risks is reasonable. It's not her fault. [Sensitive segue somehow]. Now here are the causal elements at play here.\"\n\nedit: phrasing",

You're arguing that \"blame\" is the same as \"causation\", which it isn't.  \n\nBlame is a social construct that we use to determine who, given the laws and norms of a society, broke those laws or norms and infringed on the rights of another.\n\nCausation is a different concept.  A person (unfortunately) is partly the cause of their own mugging if they are engaging in an activity that will make someone else more likely to mug them.  \n\nThey are not to blame, from a social perspective, but they are certainly part of the cause.  Assume for simplicity muggers only mug women who are scantily dressed.  Then if you are a woman, you dress scantily, and you are mugged, your dress was part of the cause.  It wasn't the whole cause, and the real world tends to deal in probabilities rather than certainties, but the points remains the same.\n\nIt is your social (and lawful) right to dress that way, so you can't be blamed.  But if you had not dressed that way, you wouldn't have been mugged, so it's clearly a different story than you're acknowledging.\n\nEvery day we all do things which decrease the chances of bad things happening to us.  I lock my doors, even though it is illegal for someone to enter my house without permission.  When I drive, I not only follow the law, I make decisions in certain situations that make it more likely I'll be safe (decisions I'm not legally required to make).\n\nI can't be blamed if someone steals all my shit if I don't lock my doors, but in a society of human beings, some of whom aren't so nice all the time, it's worth having discussions about how to act in private and public to reduce chances of harm coming to you.  \n\nBlack men are told to \"talk white\", pull their pants up, and not wear hoodies in order to not be seen as a threat.  Women are told to dress conservatively.  \n\nWhile I think that both of these situations are royally fucked up, I also want people to be as safe as possible, and one way to be safer is to acknowledge the reality that walking through a really bad part of town with your headphones in is usually a bad idea, etc.\n\nThere are those fucked up people who think the onus is on the woman not to get mugged, and that's total bullshit.  But the fact that a woman may be able to make herself safer by engaging in certain actions/wearing certain things still may be true (I actually have no idea on that statistics here, I'm just arguing the idea of causation vs. blame abstractly), and if I were a woman, I would want to know that, and probably engage in the safer activities.  Or maybe I'm just a coward.\n\nEdit:  I want to point out that bad things can happen to you even if you take ridiculous precautionary steps to stay safe.  But in a probabilistic world, all you can do is play the odds, and decreasing the odds of danger is usually seen as a positive. Some people prefer freedom to safety, and that is valid.  But there always have to be compromises until we have a perfect society.",

Causation is NOT univariate.  Causation does not exist in a vacuum.  Causation is most likely probabilistic, and must take into account a state space and the dynamics of that state space.  \n\nFor something to happen, all of the pieces which caused it must be in place, otherwise that thing wouldn't happen.  If the universe doesn't exist, nothing happens, and nothing is caused.  Thus, the universe is at least partially a cause of every action that takes place, just as you locking your window is partially a cause of not being burgled.

By your measure here, I am still part of the cause of the accident, is that correct?  It would clearly be the other driver's fault in this case, but would I be part of the cause?  Keep in mind that on the motorcycle in the scenario, I have essentially no power over the event (not necessarily 100% true, but lets assume I didn't see it coming and thus didn't/couldn't avoid the collision).\n\nA mugging event is similar in that all of the act of \"mugging\" was at the hand of someone else, and not the victim.  The victim has essentially no hand in the action primarily because they are the direct object of the action (and they're not acting upon themselves).  Since the victim is not actually contributing to the act, then how can the victim be considered to be the cause at all?  You could argue that walking down mugger's alley was a bad choice and that choice is how we can, except then we would have to consider an absurdly long chain of events when considering cause for any situation.",

Both are complicit in the same crime, so the blame can be shared between them.\n\nIf I walk down a dark street I am not committing a crime, but the man who chooses to mug me is committing a crime. I have no responsibility to myself or to society to walk on only safe streets, and I do not know for certain that anything bad will happen to me if I walk down a dark street. The man who mugs me has a responsibility to society not to mug others. He knows they will be harmed if he does so. So he is both aware of the consequences of his crime and he is aware of his responsibility to avoid it. By ignoring both, he is to blame. I, on the other hand, am neither aware I am to be mugged for walking on the street, nor am I responsible for not doing so. So you can't say I have any share in the blame for my attack.\n\nYou're mixing up scientific causation with legal and social causation. By your reasoning, we might also hold the gun manufacturer responsible for the mugger, since he wouldn't have a gun if they didn't make it. Or we might hold my boss responsible at work, since I wouldn't be walking home if I didn't have a job. Legally, however, none of those make sense, and the same can be said socially.",

Are they victims?\n\nLet's use noise pollution, instead, as it's more true.\n\nAre people who live down town expecting the same peace and quiet someone who lives outside of the core will receive?\n\nWhat of people who live next to airports, do they have a right to move in then complain about the airport noise?\n\nNo one should be attacked, that's the idea, but that's not reality. \n\nThe mugger mugging you is actually NOT the cause. That is merely the karmic reaction of multiple decisions and actions that have occurred towards the mugger. The mugger is mugging someone due to other reasons. They aren't just mugging for the sake of mugging, the karma does not start there nor does it end there.\n\nSomeone walking down a shitty street and they know it's shitty isn't actually putting themselves in a good position.

Maybe I live in a low-crime area, and the convenience of not having to carry a key makes leaving the door unlocked an acceptable risk (my parents never locked the door when I was a kid). Maybe if I am leaving the door unlocked and I get robbed, I will reassess my risk calculus and make a different choice - or maybe it will STILL be an acceptable risk.\n\nEDIT fixed typo",

And I DO think it can be very harmful when someone, ignorant of the facts of the situation, attempts to assign fault anyway.\n\nTo get a little more specific, many rape victims face this kind of fault assignment, where people ignorant of the full situation rapidly come to conclusions from incomplete information and then for some reason feel that it is appropriate to announce these conclusions loudly and publicly.\n\nEssentially, I don't disagree that informing the victim of their unsafe behavior can be a good thing. I just think that in general, nobody but close friends, family, and investigators are really in a position to accurately assign fault in realistic situations, and therefore \"explaining causation\" is nearly never appropriate and is more likely to do harm than good when executed by a random stranger or acquaintance.",

What I'm saying is that, IMO, we should analyze crimes that happen after the fact to determine what, if any, behaviours, situations, or choices tend to lead to victimization. We do this without assigning any fault to the victim for these choices. They don't even have to hear about the conclusions or be involved in the process if they don't want to (besides via the testimony they give, of course). We are simply trying to objectively determine which factors correspond to increased risk.

You burned your hand, which means you touched a hot thing. That helps. Which is why we tell children that. Intuitively, you know touching *that thing in particular* hurts. But not why. The explanation then helps get a general understanding. Then we can say \"X is hot\" and you know not to touch it. You *can*, but you get that same hurt feeling as before, so you don't.\n\nIf we had not told you, you'd go and touch some other hot thing, and burn your hand again, being sure to avoid *that particular thing*. See the problem? Knowledge helps a lot.\n\nGranted, I cant' be sure what you do/don't know. But I figure I should tell you either way to ensure you do know. Which is why I tell people things are hot, even after they burn themselves.\n\n&gt;If I stab myself with scissors, does telling me scissors are sharp help me? \n\nNo, but your actions which lead you to stab yourself might help you learn why you got stabbed. If you were running, perhaps you didn't intuit that running makes it easier to get stabbed. Or perhaps I tell you a safer way to hold scissors (upside down, but the sharp part in your hand, with the handle up). That way of holding scissors reduces the problems while moving them around. Maybe you knew that. But I don't know if you do. I could also mention they are sharp, but you are old, so you should know that by now. And I'm guessing you don't get stabbed by scissors often because you take this information into account.\n\n&gt;My response to all of these things would be \"No shit Sherlock\".\n\nA little kid might not know. Scissors are a simple example. Naturally people were told \"these are sharp, don't run with them, hold upside-down, etc\". Certainly little kids are told, both before and after. Why should other problems not be the same?\n\n&gt;My assumption here is that the victim we're discussing has at least an ounce of common sense. \n\nPerhaps they don't know that X street is dangerous and a common place  of muggings. They get mugged on X street. They might think it's simply the city, or perhaps they were targeted for some reason (wearing gang colors), or some other reason. Saying that it's X street, and lots of people get mugged there, is good information. It clues them in that it's a problem on X street, and not a problem with colors/clothing/city/time-of-day/etc.\n\nX street during the day might be fine. And maybe at night too. Sometimes the problem is simply X street at 3 o'clock. Since that's when the trouble makers get off from school. So avoid X street at 3pm, and you are good to go.\n\nThat's *very* handy to have. Although it doesn't help the problem in general, it allows the victim to prevent further problems *to themselves*. Naturally the global solution would be to focus on the perpetrators, and get them to no longer cause problems. But in the short term (and locally), giving the victim this information can help prevent future problems.\n\nSaying \"it's your fault dumbass\" doesn't help at all, and I'd agree. Sure, avoiding X street at 3pm might *seem* obvious, but perhaps you are new to town. Or maybe you just never visited X street before and don't know the advice to stay safe there.\n\n&gt;When something bad happens to a person, they know what happened.\n\nYes, they know \"what happened\" by they may not know all the causes. If you burn yourself \"touching something hot\" isn't the only cause. There's \"something hot is around\", \"someone or something made something hot\", \"there's a specific place where hot things are\", \"hot things appear at this time and for this reason\", and so on. You know to be careful around the stove, since there's hot things. But around the couch you are fine, since it's away from the danger of hot things.\n\nYou might not know that most hot things occur in the kitchen. Which would be good information. Naturally, this particular information is spread around as a kid, simply because of it's immediacy and how common it is.\n\nA mugging is less common. So naturally less people might be aware of all the causes.\n\n&gt;Telling me to look out when I trip over a branch does me no good.\n\nSure it does. \"Branches fall here all the time, so you have to watch your step\". Helps in the future, when you walk through this area again, or in the immediate future so you don't immediately trip over another branch. It might've been a one time deal with that branch in the way, sure. But knowing whether branches fall there a lot is good information.\n\nJust like how saying to \"watch your step\" on some stairs that have unequal stairs. You might fall, but not realize that's the reason you fell. So other people tell you to be careful on that staircase, because of the misaligned stairs. You might have attributed the cause to be simply your clumsiness, not realizing the stairs are actually at fault. Good information.\n\n&gt; Telling Bob tomorrow when you're walking down the street before he hits the branch does some good.\n\nRight. But if Bob tripped yesterday, and I told him yesterday after he tripped. Today he'll be equipped to know to look out without needing to tell him again. If he trips again, perhaps bring it up one more time to ensure he knows.",

Would it be helpful in any way *for you* to hear an officer in the hall saying to a reporter \"Well, the doors were unlocked.\" It's only going to make your healing situation worse, and now you're going to be blaming yourself even more than you probably already were.\n\nWhereas, say a year later and let's pretend you had two kids, your neighbor walked over and said to you, 'Yaknow, I heard about this great new alarm system.'\n\nIt's important to have that discussion (we should lock our doors), but we have to be sensitive to the victim's needs as well (who the f cares about a door, a child is dead and justice needs to happen).

So keep 'em out of it entirely *at that time*.\n\nBut all of that is dependent on this point as well:\n\n&gt;But this act is still called victim blaming by many people.\n\nEven though it's not intended to be blaming, it usually is. As I've argued before, it's a very natural tendency to victim blame for humans. It's the immediate instinct and response, basically nature. And as I've also argued before, it's all about how you approach the subject.\n\nYou may not intend to victim blame if you were to say \"Well, *everyone* knows that area is dangerous.\" Because it implies stupidity on the part of the victim. Sure, I can understand it's not *intended* to blame, but it does blame. This is why it's very difficult. It's all human nature to jump to assumptions, fill in the blanks, and mentally protect ourselves by suggesting 'That would never happen to *me* cause I know better'. \n\nThat reason alone is a good reason to avoid the first point - immediately jumping into that 'blunt' advice. That's a bit of a double-edged sword, and I'm not advocating either way (about timing), but as they say 'time heals all wounds'. Allowing the victim some time before we start talking about *all the things they did wrong* intentionally or unintentionally isn't necessarily a bad idea. But that is simply because it's hard for a person to talk about a crime without talking about the victim. But we can, and we should, do exactly that.\n\nIn the end though, at the base we agree.",

It just so happens that these commonly go hand in hand. As people who are focused on the objective causes are also less likely to sugarcoat things. For better or worse.\n\n&gt;Imagine yourself in a situation where say your child was murdered. Would it be helpful in any way for you to hear an officer in the hall saying to a reporter \"Well, the doors were unlocked.\"\n\nMakes sense. Probably what lead up to it happening too.\n\n&gt;It's only going to make your healing situation worse, and now you're going to be blaming yourself even more than you probably already were.\n\nBut I don't blame myself. That's the difference. Yes, I had a part in the event happening (leaving the kid alone, leaving the door unlocked), but I wasn't the initiator of the crime. I understand this to be the objective situation, regardless of how I feel. Pointing out facts doesn't hurt, it helps.\n\nTake when my house was broken into. I was distraught and worried about my stuff. But I appreciated when told \"be sure not to step over near the break in point or touch the door that was busted in, as there's footprints that can be recovered\" I made sure to follow that advice.\n\nWhen they said \"you should get a security system to prevent future break-ins\" I followed that advice as well. It's not that \"I didn't have a security system so I blame myself\" nope. It's just one thing that helped lead up to the event. And it's good to know.\n\nMore specifically I learned the security system itself doesn't matter. It's just the warning sign out from that does. Which means you can simply stick a sign out there and get the same security, rather than buying the system.\n\nAnother aftermath was \"should've seen it coming, the people who broke in (neighbors) had parents that scrape vin numbers from cars and sell them.\" It's a logical thing I didn't consider. Hell, I just figured the neighbors were friendly like the rest of them and that my dad was just a racist fuck.\n\nIt *also* gave me the knowledge of hiding my valuables *in my house*, when I leave for long periods of time, so if there *is* a break in, that stuff isn't stolen. This is something I didn't know until I actually was a victim. It's not victim blaming (I don't take it to be), but if I hid my stuff, it wouldn't have been stolen.\n\nLots of advice to help prevent future problems. And I see it that way.\n\n&gt;Whereas, say a year later and let's pretend you had two kids, your neighbor walked over and said to you, 'Yaknow, I heard about this great new alarm system.'\n\nA year? I'd rather the helpful info be provided immediately, like what I learned with the break-in. Didn't wait no year to get a security system. it was installed ASAP.\n\n&gt;but we have to be sensitive to the victim's needs as well (who the f cares about a door, a child is dead and justice needs to happen).\n\nPerhaps. But telling a person \"I'm praying for you\" or the equivalent is functionally useless. It gives them 0 information, and doesn't tell them anything they don't know. Whereas giving advice does.\n\n&gt; That insensitivity is why it's argued to be victim blaming, and I don't disagree with that.\n\nI agree. This is the main reason OP posted this thread. He thinks the discussion *should* be focused on that information, rather than simply being pointed out as victim blaming and promptly ignored. I agree with OP. While we shouldn't make the victim feel guilty, we should provide information to help prevent future problems.\n\n&gt;Basically, the at the time of the crime, the victim is incapable of looking at the situation objectively. So keep 'em out of it entirely at that time.\n\nI have no problem looking at events objectively during the time. Hell, that's *all* I can think about. Typically though it's not about past preventative actions, but what's going to happen in the future. Well shit I lost my stuff, what now? Track the guys, find them, call the police, get an alarm system to prevent future break ins, etc. Not \"waah I lost my stuff and I feel bad, so I can't think about anything\".\n\nPerhaps other people are different, but I like to focus on the helpful things, rather than the pointless ones.\n\n&gt;You may not intend to victim blame if you were to say \"Well, everyone knows that area is dangerous.\" Because it implies stupidity on the part of the victim.\n\nRight, the tone implies blaming the victim.\n\n&gt;Allowing the victim some time before we start talking about all the things they did wrong intentionally or unintentionally isn't necessarily a bad idea. But that is simply because it's hard for a person to talk about a crime without talking about the victim.\n\nI'd disagree here. I'd rather tackle the problem immediately, so it doesn't happen again. Yes, it was awful. No, I don't want it happening again and want to prevent it as much as I can. It seems you (and others) have the thought: yes, it was awful. No, I don't want to talk about how to prevent it in the future. Yes, I'll talk about it later (if I remember).\n\n&gt;In the end though, at the base we agree.\n\nDefinitely. I think the main difference is just the when and how.",

When I flew to SF, I knew I was going to be in a bad area, so I made sure I minimized the risk. I got a ride from the airport to the hotel, instead of taking the subway and walking. I made sure not to be out at night. I made sure to not wear earbuds so I could pay attention to my surroundings. I walked quickly, being sure to avoid eye contact and proximity with sketchy individuals. I made sure to be on the move early, ,when most people were still asleep. And so on. Did anything bad happen? Nope. Could something bad have happened? Absolutely, especially if I wasn't careful. Considering it's one of the more crime ridden areas of SF. I knew the statistics, and took care to avoid those situations.\n\nNaturally I could've chose to not go, and stay home in my safer location. Hell, I almost didn't get a room, and would've been kicked out onto the streets.\n\nBut everything went fine, because I was cautious and planned out my moves.\n\n&gt;So, what, if Mary is trying to walk home one day and she gets attacked we should all tell her it's her fault for living there? \n\nYes and no. Naturally if she didn't live there, that wouldn't have happened. But there's many other things that lead up to it as well.\n\n&gt;What if she's a child who was born there?\n\nAgain, she still has the freedom to act in safe ways. Though her general location would be her parent's fault (Why aren't they there with her?).\n\n&gt;Also, why do you persist in believing that someone who is attacked just isn't taking any steps whatsoever to protect her own safety? \n\nBecause it wasn't stated. If you are in a dark alley, in a sketchy part of town, and get mugged, I have to ask what you are doing in that dark alley.  The amount of crimes in a public well-lit space, like inside a police station, is minimal. Hanging out in a police station all day is arguably safe and there's a good chance you won't get mugged there.\n\n&gt;What if Mary is carrying mace, but it doesn't help her?\n\nThis solution implies you ignore the risk, but carry self-defense in case bad things happen. Which means you anticipated the thing to happen. This situation could've been prevented with better thinking and planning.\n\n&gt;What if the mugger uses it against her? \n\nSee above.\n\n&gt; Is she still \"responsible\" for her attack, or does she get a pass for trying to defend herself -- even if she gets hurt worse for it?\n\nBoth parties are responsible. One simply initiated. Had either party not been there, the mugging would not happen. If the mugger was in AA, and Mary was at a public mall in a well-lit space, there'd be no mugging at all!\n\nIf the mugger was there, an Mary was in a police station. There'd *still* be no mugging! This means Mary was a direct cause of Mary being mugged. Which means she can alter her actions to reduce the chance of that event.\n\nShe can't, however, change the actions of the mugger. So if I were mary, i'd avoid wherever I'd think a mugger would be. Or at least be sure to go with a group.",

What if the mugger chooses Mary because a previous mark looked too intimidating? Is he also at fault?

With the exception of children, poor people are poor because of bad decision making, poor money management, impulse acting, and other problems that go along with those.\n\n&gt;Not.\n\nNot? I'm pretty sure everything went fine. I miscounted the fact that the company was paying for the hotel, but I needed to charge it on my card. This was a risk-assessment failure on my part. But in the end, I managed to get things sorted out. If someone had told me this (or mentioned it after), I'd have known to prepare, and *know* to prepare for it next time. I know to be sure to check whether it's credit-card confirmed, whether the payment is going to me or if it's prepaid, etc.\n\n&gt;Everything went fine because you were lucky and the chance of being attacked is incredibly low, even in dangerous places.\n\nBut isn't (according to you) the reason people get attacked is because of dangerous people? You are contradicting yourself. I actually almost got scammed. But I used my brain, minimized risk, and turned down suspicious offers. Minimizing risk is the whole point.\n\n&gt;Do you think every single person who is attacked is just an idiot who isn't being cautious?\n\nMore or less. Either they didn't calculate the risks, or they lacked something in that calculation. Or perhaps they simply made a poor decision knowing the risk. Either way, they are either an idiot, or one who knew the risks and accepted them. Which is why informing them afterward is useful.\n\n&gt;Most people who are assaulted, raped, or murdered are victims of people they already know.\n\nYup, which reveals even *more* bad decision making. Why associate with people who would do that? Why keep yourself vulnerable to people who you don't know if they would do that or not? Sure, when you are younger, it makes sense to make these mistakes. I had a 'friend', who was great. But he ended up stealing from me. Looking back, it's obvious. He's a lier (which I knew, but was fine with), he came from a poor family, didn't clean up well, generally had a bad reputation,  etc. I should've known, but I didn't. Because I was a kid and wasn't told of this type of thing. I immediately broke off contact and was wary of similar individuals in the future.\n\nIn comparison, I had another poor friend, same type of situation, but he didn't steal at all, though I was careful about keeping an eye on him. He turned out to not be that great of a friend, but he was okay. I kept him at a distance.\n\nPeople have too much trust, and not enough risk awareness.\n\n&gt;In many cases, people they have a reason to trust, like friends and close family.\n\nFamily can't be trusted. At least, mine can't. They've proven that to me time and time again. Friends I take on a case-by-case. Some friends I'd trust with my life. Others I wouldn't trust with the TV. Trusting people blindly is stupid. The friends I'd trust with my life have the same attitude towards me, and I've known them my entire life. I know how they think, I know how they behave, etc. I realize there's a risk of them backstabbing me, but that's incredibly low. Other friends I have a very low tolerance for, as I mentioned.\n\n&gt; But they aren't smart like you, so it's their fault. \n\nIt's not about being smart. It's about risk-management.\n\n&gt;Similarly, if you'd been attacked, you'd be crying that it was unfair and not your fault, but you're quick to assume everyone else is a complete dumbfuck who doesn't know how to tie his shoes, much less protect his safety.\n\nNope, I've had a history of being stolen from when I was younger. When I was pretty much powerless (can't move due to parents) and stupid (being a little kid). Both are definitely fair. I simply assumed nothing could go wrong. And that was stupid. But I was a dumb kid who listened to everything the \"feel good people\" told me. Once I got my hands on the internet, the truth became clear, and I brought up my guard. Never had a problem after that.\n\n&gt;Sorry bud, you can't answer a \"should we\" question with yes and no. We either do it or we don't.\n\nAs I said, my moral response is yes and no. It's not entirely her fault. But her living there definitely is part of the cause. The straight objective answer is \"yes\", but that doesn't reflect my thoughts on the matter entirely. It's a simplification used to straw man my views. In a morally grey world, nothing is black and white. Is it okay to kill a fat man in order to save 10 thin people? Yes and no is the answer. It just depends.\n\n&gt; If you aren't sure about your morals in this situation, don't try to debate about it.\n\nMy views are very clear. But \"should we all\" is not part of them. I don't think everyone should do the same thing. I also don't think telling Mary is an obligation. I also don't think Mary is the entire reason it happened. So it's a straw man. I *must* say yes and no, it encapsulates some of my view, and other parts don't.\n\nYes, Mary was part of the cause. Yes, Mary could've prevented it by acting differently. Yes, it's a good idea to tell Mary what she could do to prevent future acts. No, it's not entirely Mary who caused the event. \n\n&gt;Did your mother walk you home from the bus stop when you were 15? That would actually explain a lot.\n\nYes and no. Again, not a straight answer, because it can't be. Some days I caught a ride with my parents, other days I took the bus. I went to a small school my entire life. I knew the people who went on the bus. Actually though, at 15 I was in high school, so yes, since it's a far distance I got a ride with my Dad in the morning when he went to work.\n\nBut in general, what the fuck are you doing in an area that isn't safe alone when you are under 18? That's ignoring the risks, which is entirely what my point is. Both the parents being ignorant *and* the child. I *chose* to stay home when I was that age. Simply because I found it a better use of my time.\n\nI also used that time to skip ahead a few years, take college classes, as well as work as a college tutor. Again, focusing on risk management and planning goals.\n\nWhat would be stupid is to go hang out in bums park at that time. Again, why the fuck would I be there? Why would my parents *let me* go there? My parents have a low risk tolerance anyway, and are pretty cautious. I don't mind it, and actually have adopted a similar mindset because of it.\n\n&gt; No but seriously, most crimes occur in private places, so the crimes occurring in dark alleyways are what's minimal.\n\nDefinitely true.\n\n&gt;Your chance to be mugged is far, far lower than your chance not to be, no matter how dark the street.\n\nI'd argue that your chance to be mugged is dependent on how much time you spend around muggers. I'd imagine muggers mug each other a lot. When you hang around criminals, you'll be involved in crimes. Makes sense.\n\n&gt;You are, in essence, accusing people of not forseeing something incredibly unlikely. \n\nWalking down dark alleys is a bad idea anyway, muggers or not. Can't see where you are going, could be wild animals (which happens, I've seen coyotes, raccoons, etc), can get lost, might have picketpockets or muggers, etc. Though it really depends on the area too. \n\nI'm not accusing people of anything. I'm saying to look at the risks, and figure out what's safest, if that matters to you.\n\n&gt; I might as well ask why you visit your family on the holidays, since there's a statistic chance they'll rape and murder you.\n\nI typically don't. I also acknowledge that there's a good chance of domestic violence, rampant alcoholism and drinking, etc. I acknowledge these facts when I visit, and I visit typically because I enjoy (most of them anyway) their sober opinions on things. I don't typically like my Dad, but when he's sober he's pretty responsible, which I like. When he's drunk, I avoid him. My mom is chill mostly. Sober she's fun and has cool thoughts. Drunk she just complains a lot, nothing that bad. My siblings are fine. Most of them share a similar mindset than me, and if need be I can defend myself from them (haha).\n\nOther family I don't visit at all. And if my immediate family visits them (and I tag along) I treat them as strangers, not family.\n\nSo yes, I'm well aware of the risks and if something were to happen, I acknowledge I made a bad move and it's partly my fault I got into it.\n\n&gt;Not all risks can be avoided. \n\nRight, but they can be minimized. Though most of the time, the victim didn't minimize anything.\n\n&gt;What if there's no alternative but to go down the dark street to get home?\n\nThis implies you passed the street originally. When leaving the house, be sure to follow lit streets. Easy.\n\n&gt;Where I live, there are miles and miles of land with no streelights, and neighborhoods with several blocks that have no light at all. \n\nMove to an area that does. Easy.\n\n&gt;Not everyone is so fortunate as to be able to get rides everywhere, particularly poor people who can't afford the gas.\n\nI actually walk. I live in a well lit area, and one that is generally considered the safest city in the US. I chose it intentionally. The entire place is actually owned by one huge company, which the city is named after. So pretty much everything around is land owned by them, and there's security all over the place and well trusted workers. No problems.\n\n&gt;What if the mugger chooses Mary because a previous mark looked too intimidating?\n\nMy argument is on opportunistic crimes, not premeditated ones. Which is an entirely different story. If someone sees Mary in their yearbook, remembers her and wants to kill her. There's nothing Mary can do to minimize the risk. She *is* the target. The only thing to do would then be avoid her killer. Which she couldn't know about. In this case, you'd have a point.\n\nMy point (like OP) is to discuss rational and logical ways of minimizing risks that the victim could've done.\n\n&gt;if the mugger had no expenses, he wouldn't be out mugging people.\n\nTrue, and this is what we should focus on, why the mugger committed the crime.",

In fact, anecdotally, we see this very often. We often see people (men and women) stay in an abusive relationship. These people intrinsically know that said relationship is unhealthy, they just don't leave it. I don't want to get into the causes of this, because there are many, but it is safe to cite this as an example of people going against their best interest. \n\nI agree that we need to stop blatant victim blaming. We shouldn't tell girls not to wear skirts because they're asking for it. That's wrong.\n\nKnow what isn't wrong though? Telling a girl she shouldn't get so drunk that she can't consent to sex. If you do that, you're putting yourself at risk. It's a stupid decision. Is it the girls fault that she got raped? No. But that doesn't mean that getting drunk off your ass is a good decision. \n\nWe, as a society, don't feel bad for smokers who develop lung cancer. You participated in a high risk activity, and it back fired. We have no problem telling a smoker that they're putting themselves at risk for smoking, why do we have a problem telling a binge drinking frat girl that she's putting herself at risk to be raped. \n\nWe need to get to a place in society where we can say \"you did a stupid thing\" without it meaning \"you deserved to be sexually violated\". We're at that place with smoking. Cancer survivors are told not to smoke anymore, and what other high risk activities they should limit. We aren't there yet with rape, and I would argue we are moving further and further from it.",

Being abused in childhood is going to affect you extremely on a mental level to make completely different sets of life choices, and yes I can see many of them would be destructive choices. \n\nIn regards to abusive relationships as well - both of these things are typically very mental and usually long-term situations. They are going to completely affect you in every aspect of your life.\n\nWhat I say only applies to a normal, mentally healthy person before the attack. I'm not qualified at all, and don't intend to present myself as an expert in abuse victims.\n\n&gt;If you do that, you're putting yourself at risk.\n\nI think I need to edit my original post. I am not trying to suggest that we do not warn women about ways to protect themselves from being abused. My response was only concerning the discussion of the event after the fact, generally around people who are not directly involved with the victim. \n\nIf you read an article or see on the news 'Young woman mugged on First Avenue' and all it says is that basic information, you're unqualified to judge or blame anything because you simply do not have the facts. You can discuss the situation (\"oh that's a bad area\") but you need to exclude the victim, because you do not have the ability to appropriately judge the situation. Victim blaming typically relies on assumptions ('oh she should have known that was a bad area'). Well, the article didn't tell you she's from another state.\n\nI completely agree people need to educate and protect themselves. Asking someone to protect themselves is not victim blaming *because they are not a victim*. \n\n&gt;\"you did a stupid thing\" without it meaning \"you deserved to be sexually violated\"\n\nI have a problem with this because if you're in that situation, either one of two things has happened: *you know you did a stupid thing* or you didn't have the information at the time to make the correct choice. Everyone knows now that smoking causes cancer. Yes, I'm fine with telling someone who smokes today they are stupid. 30 years ago though, smoking was commonly known to be healthy. What good does calling those people stupid do?\n\nIf people don't know, educate them.\n\nIf people do know, give them a break. We're human. We fuck up. Rubbing it in does no good for anyone.",

However, they also point out that younger victims have an increased risk.\n\n&gt;What good does calling those people stupid do?\n\nI also don't mean literally \"you did a stupid thing\" it was meant more as a placeholder.\n\n&gt;I have a problem with this because if you're in that situation, either one of two things has happened: you know you did a stupid thing or you didn't have the information at the time to make the correct choice.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that everyone who is drinking is aware of the fact that drinking inhibits your ability to make good decisions. You would have a better argument regarding experience. \"Campus rape is caused by excessive drinking by people who do not know how their body metabolizes alcohol or at what point they will become incapable of making sound decisions\" is a better argument than just saying they didn't know they were putting themselves at risk.\n\n&gt;If people do know, give them a break.

We're at a place in society where people are upset that girls need to watch their drinks or not get black-out drunk. I don't agree with that. Everyone should watch their drinks. That's an important risk mitigating action you can take. People should not get black out drunk. I think we as a society should be allowed to tell people who have been abused as a result of these high risk actions that they're making bad decisions. We tell people who get lost in the forest that they should tell a friend when they go hiking next. We tell people who crash their cars because they were speeding that they should not speed. We tell victims of theft that they should make sure valuables aren't visible from outside. The only things we can't really do are tell female victims of assault or sexual assault that they should avoid the things that put them at high risk to be revictimized. I think that's a problem.",

Should we hand out guns to every citizen? Should we increase police patrol in these areas? How do we balance budgets for the increased police force? What other areas of the budgets can we improve to allocate resources better to the community?\n\nIf say, Mary was murdered in a shooting. Are our gun laws strict enough? Was there something mentally wrong with this person and how do we improve mental care? Was this person not able to afford mental care, and if so how can we improve poverty or jobs or the healthcare system to improve these things?\n\nIf you want to make it smaller, you can focus it on small communities.

Should we host self defense classes? \n\nThese and more are all the conversations that should be started.\n\nIf that isn't an answer you'll have to clarify the question.",

How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nJust because it's done by accident, doesn't mean she didn't in part cause the event to happen. You wouldn't die in a plane crash if you didn't fly in planes. So yes, it's partly your fault you died in a plane crash. Does that mean it's solely the victim's fault? No. But their assessment of risk was obviously wrong, and that's definitely their fault.\n\nWalking around at night in an unfamiliar area? To me that screams 'danger!'. Getting lost? Bad planning. I always know where I'm going. Got in a fight? Don't cause fights and cause tension when driving around an unknown area.\n\nAll of those would be avoidable to the extent that you wouldn't be stranded in an unsafe, unfamiliar area.\n\n&gt;It's assumed that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. \n\nThough it does. The problem is that Mary was mugged. The cause was that a mugger chose someone in an unsafe area (that street), and Mary happened to be there. Remove either Mary or the Mugger, and the problem is solved.\n\nHad Mary been in her house, or in a public place or something, she wouldn't have been mugged. That is a fact.\n\nIs it Mary's fault she got mugged? Partly. The crime itself was not caused by Mary. But she was in part the reason she was the victim.\n\n&gt;The world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. \n\nTrue. Which is why people adjust their behavior to *avoid* situations like the one Mary got into. Mary apparently lives in fantasy land where nothing bad happens, and thus doesn't account for it in her risk assessment.\n\n&gt; By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\"\n\nBut it's true. I've never been mugged. Ever. Though my house *has* been broken into, simply because I lived with my parents, and had a bad location (their choice). We then installed security systems. Not because we caused the crime. But because we reacted to it. Mary is the type of person who wouldn't install a security system. Simply because it's not her fault if her house is broken into.\n\n&gt;When we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nYour proposal is: \"that street is dangerous\". Which is *not* the problem and actually *avoids* the problem in general. The problem is that *one person* picked *mary* to mug. There's a few solutions. One is to get the mugger to stop mugging. Difficult. The alternative is to have mary avoid the mugger by avoiding places she knows he'll be. Easy.\n\nImproving the safety of the street does absolutely nothing to solve the problem, seeing as the mugger will mug her on the next street over.\n\n*You* actually seem to be the one ignoring the problem itself.",

Which is why they hang out in shady locations.\n\n&gt;Someone else earlier mentioned that it is unlikely you will get mugged in times square, however, pickpocketing is rampant there and yet thousands of tourists walk through it every day.\n\nSure. Pickpocketing is discrete. And is something to be wary of when you are in a crowd, since it's easy to do when there's lots of people around. In this case, be sure to move your things to your front pockets (where it's hard to access by a 3rd party), and be sure to zip up your bags, preferably locking them. And hold them close.\n\nThis is true of any populated area. Just like you don't leave your shit lying around. Amusingly, I lived in 'the safest city in the US' (determined by crime rate) people left their shit all around. I come from an area high in crime. If you left your shit like that it'd get stolen. So people knew not to do it. In this safe location, people did it anyway. if they got their shit stolen, it's their fault for leaving it there, not taking proper precaution.\n\nI've never had something stolen, besides the one point when I was growing up (no power over where I lived) and my house got broken into. It was the sketchy neighbors who scraped the vin numbers off cars and sold them. Obviously they were no good. All my life I told my parents how shitty of a place we live is, they didn't care, bunkered down with an expensive house anyway. And voila, we got broken into. In response, we got a security system (which stays mostly off, but the sign is in the yard), and new neighbors. No more incidents or problems. Yet, there's problems in the immediate area (like next street over).\n\nSo yes, there's things you can do to minimize risk, depending on what you want to minimize risk of.",

You bought a plane ticket, the plane then crashed. It is your fault you died in a plane crash. It is *not* your fault that the plane itself crashed. Just that you were on it.\n\n&gt;I am not trying to suggest that people have no responsibility for their own personal safety. \n\nThis is commonly the reason people point out 'victim-blamers'. The point is that people have responsibility for their safety. And they are always at fault for their location and situation. Avoiding bad situations and going to good ones is entirely the responsibility of the person.\n\nIs it their fault the crime occurred? No. But it's their fault they were the victim (provided that the crime would have occurred had another person been in that situation).\n\n&gt; But the reverse applies as well, shouldn't it? Sure, it's hard to get rid of that mugger. But we can do a lot to improve the situations around us.\n\nNaturally. Though you might not be able to 'blame' the mugger. Perhaps it's a mental illness. We shouldn't punish that. We should get it fixed. If someone jumps off a building because they are depressed, is that their fault? Partly. They have a mental illness, and they didn't keep check on their mental health. No mental illness, and they wouldn't have done that. But they still chose to jump off the building.\n\nSo instead of throwing the person in jail or punishing them (or 'victim-blaming'), we should treat the problem itself, and reduce the chances of it happening. One way is to remove all the buildings. But that doesn't solve the problem, it just removes that particular instance. The root of the problem is the illness. Not the person or situation.\n\nWith the mugger, same thing. What's the reason they mugged? Try to fix that, rather than simply punish.\n\nOn the flip side, the victim should also be aware of how to avoid those situations. Regardless of whether or not they are the one who initiated the action (they might have been). Say they were taunting a drunk guy. It's their fault they got punched. Don't taunt drunk people and you won't get punched. Simple. But you can 'blame the victim/perp' by saying \"when you are drunk you shouldn't punch people\" and that the drunk guy is at fault.\n\nBoth are true. The victim initiated by causing an action in the perp. The perp then initiated the crime. If the victim didn't taunt the perp, the perp wouldn't have striked.\n\n&gt;Yes, I completely agree we should do things like warn others before they hit a dangerous street, or tell people to lock their doors, or other common-sense things.\n\nThis is the topic at hand. Discussing what both society and the victim did that caused the problem. Yet, this gets called 'victim-blaming'.\n\n&gt; I was targeting the conversations that happen afterwards.\n\nThe conversations afterwards should focus on how to prevent the problem in any way possible. For the victim, that means not doing the things that lead to that type of situation. Like, being sure to lock your door. You could cry 'victim-blaming' to that. But it's not. It's giving an objective rational explanation for something that lead to the problem.\n\n\"Fault\" shouldn't even be part of the conversation, IMO.",

No real way to minimize risk. Perhaps not work in a well known building?\n\n&gt;and a child who is molested is to blame for their molestation.\n\nDepends on the actions really. For children it's a bit more difficult, as their minds and decision making abilities haven't developed, and they are smaller/weaker physically. They also have a \"must follow authority\" mindset, which makes them more susceptible to abuse.\n\nBut if you take a teenager (still child molestation), there's a chance the teenager initiated the conduct and the adult followed through.\n\nChildren also don't have much control over where they can go and what they can do. So again it's much more difficult to minimize risks (and depending on the kid, they might not even realize there's a risk in the first place).",

The mere existence of a person in a place does not place them \"at fault\" for anything. All you are saying is \"things happen because things\". The sun rises because the earth rotates, so the earth is at fault for the sun rising. Sure, whatever. That has no relevance to anything we're discussing.\n\nSo maybe we should use the word \"culpable\" instead of \"fault\" here to clarify exactly what we mean. Culpable simply means \"to blame\". \n\nIs the victim culpable for being mugged? No. To suggest otherwise would be victim blaming. Yes: Regardless of personal responsibility, *because that's a completely separate issue*. \n\nAnd that's my entire point in my original response.

It's completely possible. We have no proof either way. \n\nThat is the exact moment where victim blaming occurs. These assumptions. A person makes an argument on the assumption that the robbery would not have occurred if the door had been locked, despite no proof. (Don't jump the gun here, finish reading.) We assume the woman was raped because she was wearing a short dress. We assume the guy was mugged because of the money clip. We have no proof of any of these assumptions. \n\nCan we discuss these things? Wearing a short dress, carrying a money clip, locking your door? YES. Of course we can. But not in regards to the specific victim, because we have no proof they are related. Involving the specific victim shifts the entire discussion away from the root of the problem, as you said!\n\nI can say \"That's an unsafe neighborhood, we shouldn't carry expensive things around with us.\" That is an intelligent reasonable discussion on personal safety that does not include the victim in any regard.

But that's why a discussion is necessary, rather than to drown it out with \"VICTIM BLAMING LA LA LA CANT HEAR YOU!\" While technically suicide would prevent further crimes being done to you, it's not an optimal solution. Just like being in your house 24/7 would work, but is also not optimal. At some point there's a bit of risk, and each person has a tolerance for that risk.\n\n&gt;As my original post says, it completely depends on how the topic is approached. Yes, you can share information to an uneducated person to prevent bad situations from occurring.\n\nThis is the point being addressed. Whenever you attempt to share advice to the victim, it gets construed as victim blaming. Which isn't the intent most of the time.\n\n&gt;Well, you made it a part of the argument. The topic is victim blaming, and that includes arguing about the definition of victim blaming because not everyone agrees to the extent of it.\n\nFor this arguement/discussion, yes. But I meant more of in the terms of what we should do to fix an individual problem. We shouldn't say \"it's this random criminal's fault!\" just like we shouldn't say \"it's this random victim's fault!\" we should say: here's x/y/z of what happened and what lead up to it. Some actions were done by both parties. Here's a way to fix it to prevent future things from happening.\n\nBy pointing fault and blame, it's being counterproductive. Both are at fault, technically.\n\n&gt;I don't agree this definition you use is relevant at all, and its not the normal definition that the average person uses, so you just make this all confusing. The mere existence of a person in a place does not place them \"at fault\" for anything. All you are saying is \"things happen because things\".\n\nThis is true though. How do you define fault in a useful way? IMO you can't. The most accurate would be to describe the causes that lead up to it. The least accurate and useful would be to say it's the criminal, which we already have a word for. What use do you have by using the word when discussing an event? Note that the people who call out 'victim blaming' are the ones using fault. Not the people giving advice.\n\n&gt;So maybe we should use the word \"culpable\" instead of \"fault\" here to clarify exactly what we mean. Culpable simply means \"to blame\".\n\nWhy do we need to blame anything? Why not simply state the causes and actions that lead up the the event and how to avoid them? Blaming things is useless.\n\n&gt;Is the victim culpable for being mugged? No. To suggest otherwise would be victim blaming. Yes: Regardless of personal responsibility, because that's a completely separate issue.\n\nI would say they are, in part, responsible for the event to occur. If they weren't present, the event wouldn't occur. Whether their intention was to cause it or not doesn't matter (it does when apprehending criminals though). It's like if you pulled the table cloth and a glass fell. You caused the glass to fall. You may not have intended it, but that's what happened when you did your actions. Don't pull the table cloth, and the glass won't fall (whoops, victim blaming, I forgot).\n\n&gt;And that's my entire point in my original response. Victim blaming and the discussions had afterward are in no way related to each other when the discussion is had correctly UNLESS you can prove culpability, like your example of a person getting punched when provoking a drunk guy. You can prove the guy was provoked, because there would be witnesses.\n\nBut what if provoking him was unintended? Simply someone speaking their mind, unintentionally provoking the other person, who then initiated the conflict? This can be stretched further to thieves. Is flashing around expensive gadgets provoking a thief? Either way, both are causes in the same way: helping build motive for a crime/problem.\n\nThe point isn't to point fault at the victim. It's to help the victim realize what they can do to prevent future similar problems. Whether it be the direct cause or not. Driving accidents are solely caused by driving, regardless who's at fault. So if you don't drive, you won't get into one. Simple. It's \"victim blaming\" according to you, but also valuable advice.\n\n&gt;That is where the line gets blurry, on \"unless you can prove culpability\". Is the victim culpable for their house being robbed because they didn't lock their door? Well, we don't frankly know. Would the robbery have happened if the door had been locked? It's completely possible. We have no proof either way.\n\nThis is why it's pointless to discuss. As for who's responsible is for the law to decide. What we are talking about here is what the victim can do to make themselves safer from future crimes. Which is somehow construed as victim blaming. We aren't saying \"the victim's actions forced the crime to take place\". We are saying \"the victim can take certain actions to reduce the chance of being a victim.\"\n\n&gt;That is the exact moment where victim blaming occurs. These assumptions. A person makes an argument on the assumption that the robbery would not have occurred if the door had been locked, despite no proof. \n\nNot quite, they make the assumption that the robbery has a less chance of happening if the door is locked. Which is statically true.\n\n&gt;We assume the woman was raped because she was wearing a short dress. \n\nFalse assumption, but sure. I'd agree it's important to note what actually contributes to the causes, rather than what we perceive it to be.\n\n&gt;We assume the guy was mugged because of the money clip. \n\nPeople get mugged for money. People flashing around money are mugged more often. Thus, flashing around money makes you have a higher chance of getting mugged. Avoid flashing around money, and you'll reduce the chance you get mugged.\n\nIt's not that simply doing the act of pulling out money makes you automatically get mugged. But that it's tempting to criminals, and definitely increases the risk of a mugging.\n\n&gt;We have no proof of any of these assumptions\n\nSure we do. We have research/statistics that show that locks decrease burglars, 'looking poor' decreases muggings, etc. I think the \"short dress\" thing is the only one unfounded. IIRC, most rapes are done by people they are familiar with, so clothing isn't as much of an issue.\n\n&gt;Can we discuss these things? Wearing a short dress, carrying a money clip, locking your door? YES. Of course we can. But not in regards to the specific victim, because we have no proof they are related.\n\nRight. But we cans suggest these things as future actions to take to reduce risk. Not saying that's what prompted the event (naturally). But it might be a contributing cause that can be reduced or removed.\n\n&gt;Involving the specific victim shifts the entire discussion away from the root of the problem, as you said!\n\nTrue. The specific victim isn't all that important to the discussion, other than to look at what *actually* was a cause. The \"victim blaming\" is mostly (from what I see) trying to give this advice *to* the victim. Not saying it caused it, but saying \"hey, don't flash money around. Not saying you did, but it's a good thing to keep in mind if you don't want to be mugged.\"\n\nNaturally if you say \"you're dumb for flashing money around.\" that's bad, not useful, etc. The implication is the above sentence, but it comes out as victim blaming and assuming that was the cause (when it might not have been).\n\nAnd I think this is the real issue. People who call out victim blaming see the latter. The people who get called victim blamers attempt to do the former and sometimes appear as the latter.\n\nBut sometimes it's a specific cause. Person walked into X street and got mugged. X street is known to have a lot of muggings. Giving them advice to stay away from X street is good advice, and probably a core reason they (in particular) got mugged. Of course the mugger is the criminal and the sole cause (he was gonna mug someone regardless), but the victim can reduce their risk by avoiding X street.\n\n&gt;I can say \"That's an unsafe neighborhood, we shouldn't carry expensive things around with us.\" That is an intelligent reasonable discussion on personal safety that does not include the victim in any regard. The two issues are separated and now the conversation is valuable.\n\nI think this is what OP is trying to get at. Perhaps it's not the exact reason things happened, but it's a probable cause, and giving that advice to the victim might help them in the future.\n\nBut I agree, simply blaming the victim isn't helpful.",

These discussions are where those changes start, by educating ourselves and our neighbors.\n\n&gt;It is not victim blaming to tell someone \"if you do x then y becomes a much more likely result.\" \n\nCorrect. But that's not what you first said. There is a difference between \"Mary shouldn't have gone there because she will get mugged\" and \"That's not a safe area, muggings happen a lot there.\" \n\nThe first sentence makes so many assumptions. What if Mary lives there? Works there? Got lost? Got kicked out of a car? Got drugged and had her kidney removed for the black market and dumped there? Kid ran away and she's looking for him? So on and on. It directs the conversation away from the mugging and to Mary and why Mary is in the wrong. And the funny part is no one partaking in this discussion has any idea why Mary is there or what happened around this situation (because I've never provided a reason, just possibilities), yet that's the thing people keep bringing up. Mary shouldn't. Well, you don't know. \n\nThe second sentence talks about the crime, the situation, and begins a discussion on personal safety. Is it relevant to discuss bad areas (the place Mary was in)? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss ways a person can protect themselves? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss signs of danger? Yes! Is it valuable to discuss ways to avoid bad situations? Yes! That conversation is incredibly important and valuable and we should all have these conversations. Mary is not involved in these conversations, and should simply be a prompt for the dialog.",

            "text": "&gt; The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behaviour prevented us from getting mugged again.\n\nIn your case you examined the causation and were fortunate enough to be in a position where you were actually able act upon it. \nBut for people who live in that area, have loved ones who live there, people who work there or go to school there or have no reasonable option but to walk through that area at certain times of the day: what would you have them do? How is you telling them “well, I was able to change my behaviour and it’s prevented me from being mugged again” in any way a worthwhile endeavour? I'm sure if you repeated your above quote to them, they'd be *super* appreciative. \n\nYeah, I’m going to use the “P” word (sorry!) but your point of view comes from a position of (small p) privilege. You are fortunate enough to have a workable solution – not everyone else will be and having causation repeated to them over and over again isn’t exactly helpful for them, it’s demoralising and endlessly frustrating. \n\nFor a real-life example, there was a news story from Montreal a few months ago regarding a spate of sexual assaults in taxis. The police warned women to not [use taxis alone](http://www.ccla.org/rightswatch/2014/10/16/montreal-police-criticized-for-advice-to-women-in-response-to-taxi-assaults). Which is super easy for the cops to say when they aren’t the ones who would be most affected by not using taxis alone. It might be fine for some people, but it kind of sucks if, say, you’re a young woman who works in a bar at the other side of town and your only other option is walking home at 3am on a Saturday night. What do you have her do? Just not go to work for weeks on end? \n\nExplaining causation can be useful if you have the option to readjust. But for people who have no other realistic options: what would you have them do? \n\nTelling a turkey that is isn’t a good idea to be a turkey in November doesn’t help the turkey very much.",

So that's very relevant.\n\nI am reconsidering the latter of my two points, which is that it's a worthwhile endeavor. Specifically: it's not always worthwhile to explain causation to someone, because many times they know already and cannot change the situation (maybe they work or live in an unsafe area, etc.). Do you think it's a worthwhile discussion to have in general, though? Like when people say things like \"we need to have a societal conversational about X\"?

If you're in the wrong part of town, go to the right part of town. If a certain place creates poor achievers, move to the places that procure high achievers. If a third of the women in the military get raped, don't go into the military. \n\nThis creates two problems. \n1.  Many people don't have the options you suggest. They may live in a shit part of town and not have the funds to move. In southern states it gets very hot, and so not showing skin for the sake of safety or security is extremely uncomfortable. Many people who get assaulted are very attractive and get harassed or groped even when taking precautions to downplay their good looks. Many don't have the expendable cash to avoid risky jobs or environments. These variables seem obvious to you and if one had the choice, they should choose the safest alternative. Most people choose the safest option they have, and often their safest option is still not the \"good part of town\" and would warrant the warning you suggest. \n\n\n2. Pushing back against criminal activity is significantly more effective on crime as a whole than taking a safer route. Adding lights, police officers, carrying weapons, etc is much more effective at deterring future crime than suggesting the safest route. When you advise one person to take a safer route, you don't stop the crime as much as deflect the crime to the next guy. This may work to help the individual, but as a community putting your efforts into lowering crime rather than encouraging the individual to avoid criminally active areas makes your community a better place.",

For most of human history, including recent U.S. history, this type of behavior was okay.  It was the natural consequence of a woman acting \"loose,\" and it *was* her fault.  And even in the current environment, lines can get (ugh) blurred.\n\nSo, it's valid to call for some messaging and education correcting that perception and affirming that we're in a new paradigm, where you really do need consent.\n\nI'm not saying campus anti-rape campaigns are never irrational, never go overboard, etc.  Of course they do.

I want to note I don't think this inexperience makes you a bad person or an idiot, it's just data you may not have to put into consideration. While speaking about causation can be beneficial in a vacuum, there is an overall context that may make it harmful, and when and how you discuss it can lead to it being potentially more damaging than helpful.\n\nWhen I entered my friend's room after they called me about being assaulted, I found them sobbing and repeating to themself \"I'm so stupid.\" They had invited someone they didn't know very well into their room - something just about everyone I've known has done multiple times - and, in this case, it turned out for the worst.\n\nIf someone had come in and said to my friend, \"well, inviting someone into your room is a risky thing to do,\" then I wouldn't be frustrated with that person because they were wrong, I would be frustrated with them because they were being emotionally inconsiderate. Yes, there were logical decisions on my friend's part that put them at risk, but my friend is already dealing with emotionally damaging self-blaming and self-loathing, and this just throws fuel on the fire. When someone is unable to leave a room for 3 weeks because of waking up in the middle of the night sobbing and having flashbacks, you pointing out how they could have lessened their chance of this occurring is not on the top of the list of things that need to be addressed. Later, when that person is speaking with a trusted therapist who can unwind causality from self-blame, is a more appropriate context to discuss the the issue with that person.\n\nI'd equate it to walking up to someone whose dog was hit by a car and saying, \"dog-chains will keep the dog away from the street and make it less likely to be hit by a car.\" You're not logically wrong, but you're not really helping. By pointing out the causality to the owner - who is likely already blaming themself - you're likely hurting them more than your information is worth. In addition, you're not fully informed; for all you know, the owner's last dog strangled itself on its chain, and he just put in a fence that the new dog dug under. This is why there are commenters in this thread who are saying people are being unempathetic; they're not seeing the emotional context of the event, and just focusing on the logical context - considering the causality in a vacuum instead of as part of a whole incident. Again, this is not because they're stupid, but because they likely have never had a full context on an issue like this before.\n\nThis is not to say that conversations shouldn't be had about dangerous areas, or that people shouldn't be warned about dangerous activities; those things lead to better-informed citizens and better policing, as well as other endeavors such as improved lighting for areas that are high-crime. However, there needs to be a question of when and with whom that conversation should be had; in cases like sexual assualt, I think the causation argument should be had with the therapist. People who see it on the news and say it, especially without the full context, are potentially doing more damage to the person than they are helping, without realizing it.",

This is just like how a person on the street isn't a cause for their mugging, even though they happened to be present at the same time as the mugger.\n\n&gt; The whole point of this topic is that causes should be examined to see what did and did not contribute. You keep making up scenarios just to point out things that are not a cause. \n\nAnd I'm explaining that these things happen irrespective of what the OP considers causes. Both locked and unlocked houses get robbed, and the vast majority of unlocked houses *don't* get robbed. To say not locking a door caused a robbery is simply wrong.",

Notice how none of the 'victim-blamers' use 'fault', nor do they say that the person was the *reason* for the crime. They simply suggest things and possibly say \"X was a bad move. That was stupid.\"\n\nIt's like calling someone an idiot for not locking their doors when they immediately get broken into. They are an idiot. Especially if the intruder was simply looking for an unlocked door.\n\nIt's not victim-blaming. It's pointing out the obvious cause for why it happened *to them*. Granted, locking your door could still make you the victim, had they busted it down, or went through a window. In which case, perhaps the victim could do nothing more. They would then not be 'blamed' because there's no obvious cause for why they were picked.\n\nIt's like hanging around your creepy uncle simply because he's your uncle. If you get raped, you should've seen it coming. Rapists come from your circle of acquaitences most of the time, and if he's creepy and being rapist-like, you should probably avoid him. Not hang around because of familial bonds.\n\n&gt;The behavior of the perpetrator needs to be changed, not the behavior of the victim in most cases.\n\nYou could easily equate the perpetrator to a victim as well. To take some silly examples: Mind control, hypnosis, being tricked, etc. And some serious ones: Being drunk, Mental illness, desperate measures (commit this crime or you die!).\n\nBy saying it's the perpetrators fault with no reason for the cause, you are \"victim-blaming\" the perpetrator. Yes, the perpetrator is the initiator of the crime. Yes, changing their behavior patterns will reduce crime in the long-term. No, this will not prevent Mary from being raped. Mary can still be raped by the thousands of other rapists. It's not John's fault that he happened to be the one to do it. He simply happened to be the cause.\n\nYes, it's John's fault John raped someone. But that action could've been caused by a number of things, as I mentioned.\n\nWhat needs to be addressed is the specific conditions that allowed for the crime, rather than simply who's to blame.\n\nIf a house it broken into, provide better security for the house/neighborhood, as well as look into why the perp did it. Did they need money? Perhaps the solution is to relocate them to a better living condition, where they aren't as desperate. That's one way to solve the problem.\n\nMaybe it's the area in general? In this case, perhaps it's the culture that needs to change. Less focus on aggression-based media, perhaps. More lessons on personal safety, and personal-responsibility, as well as teaching risk-assessment. Not just to the 'victims' but to the 'perpetrators' as well. Chances are that the perp is just a regular guy who got thrown into a bad situation either mentally or physically.\n\nDo you blame alchoholics for being the way they are? To line up with your views, you should answer NO. Yet, the only person responsible is the alchoholic themselves. If this drunk person then committed a crime while drunk, is it their fault?\n\nAt this point your logical answer should be no. Yet your other answers would *also* point to YES (being that the perpetrator is the one at fault always).\n\nMy answer is yes to both. It's yes to being an alcoholic (you didn't have to drink, and could technically stop). And it's yes to committing a crime while choosing to be drunk.\n\nLots of causes, and it's important to look at them objectively, rather than simply trying to make everything about a good guy and bad guy.",

Primarily because it's useful discussion on how to protect the victim in the future, as well as get rid of the problem.\n\nOP thinks 'victim-blaming' should be considered stuff like \"don't be an idiot' which doesn't contribute at all, and simply harasses the victim.\n\nI agree. 'victim-blaming' in this sense is bad/wrong/not useful. In the sense that many people use it (explaining causation, which may be due to the victim's actions) is important discussion, and that the victims should still use caution.\n\nPrimarily I think people should pay more attention to risks. if you see a high risk thing, or don't pay attention to it and do it anyway, you are partly at fault. You did a high-risk activity. You don't have anyone but yourself to blame when that risk happens.\n\nBut simply pointing out how stupid someone is isn't helpful. What *is* is to provide more information, perhaps they didn't figure out the right risk and it's much higher than they thought. Perhaps they simply didn't take a precaution that they could have. Pointing this stuff out helps prevent future problems in similar situations.\n\n'victim-blaming' shouldn't be mentioned at all. Who's 'fault' it is doesn't particularly matter. What matters is what caused it, which might be causes on the victim's part. Whether or not that means the victim is at fault is irrelevant.",

As I said, \"blame\" implies a level of justification that \"cause\" does not. There is a negative connotation around blame. Regarding \"cause\" - you are correct in an earlier comment that there are many factors that go into an outcome. \n\nI didn't say wearing a revealing outfit is a dangerous activity. In my examples, I focused much more on things like the parts of a city one chooses to frequent at night. Part of my point is that it hopefully generates a productive discussion by considering all these factors leading to an outcome - it helps you understand that outcome better.\n\nThose \"car accident factors\" are all, of course, things different people take into consideration. If you crash your car and fly through the windshield and die - because you weren't wearing your seatbelt - then wearing your seatbelt might have saved your life. Even if someone else crashed into you and you had no control over that - you had control over whether to wear a seatbelt.\n\nI'm not saying people OUGHT to wear a seatbelt. I wear a seatbelt.

You should know that risk, and are partly to blame if it happens. I don't drive. I know the risks and choose not to. When I ride with someone else (rarely), I know that there's a significantly higher chance of death, and it scares the shit out of me. I ensure I'm with a good driver, driving at a safe time/location, and so on to minimize those risks.\n\nMany of my friends also avoid freeways/highways, since those are also high danger areas. They use GPS to find safer alternative roads.\n\nI'd say it's more situational awareness and safety, than object-based. Know the risks.\n\n&gt;Is it reasonable to cover up as if you were in the middle east just so a man won't rape you? \n\nAbsolutely. If uncovered women get raped often, while covered women don't. And I was a woman in that area, I'd *choose* to cover up to be safer. Just like how I choose to put on a jacket to stay warm and prevent colds. Yes, if the disease wasn't there I wouldn't get sick. But there's no use in blaming the disease and instead should minimize my risk of getting sick. Don't stay out in the cold, be sure to put on a jacket, don't hang around sick people, etc.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure you can separate cause and blame. Your sentiment is essentially \"if you hadn't been doing x, then y would not have happened\". You can dress it up by saying it's cause and not blame, but it is blame.\n\nBlame implies it's personal. It's not. It's not *you*, it's what you did. Which are two distinct things. *Why* you did the things that increased risk is not really a concern. It could be choice, forced, whatever. But you did, and so it increased risk. Blame also implies that one person is at fault. They aren't. There are multiple reasons for why something happened. Had either person not been there, it wouldn't have happened.\n\n&gt;Wearing a revealing outfit is a dangerous activity?\n\nStatistics say no, and that rape is commonly done by someone you know. In this case, be wary of letting down your guard (getting drunk or whatever) when around potential rapists.\n\nHow often do strippers get raped? Do we have a statistic? I'm actually curious. I'd imagine it's less than the average person, even though their occupation is taking off their clothes. Simply because they are in a 'safe' area, and don't stray off with a stranger. They also stay sober while working. They minimize risk, especially since sexual activities are immediately related to their line of work.\n\n&gt;If they aren't wearing a revealing outfit, we pick another reason (out late at night, at a party, drinking, etc).\n\nBecause people do a lot of stupid shit. If you jaywalk, there's a higher chance you'll be hit by a care. People do it anyway. If you drink, there's various medical problems that can occur. We know smoking leads to cancer. Yet, people do these things anyway. If you smoke and get cancer, it's not the cancer's fault. It's yours. For smoking when you knew the risk.\n\nCertainly if cancer didn't exist that would prevent the problem as well. But we focus on the things we *can* change.\n\n&gt;The point is people do these things safely the overwhelming majority of the time. \n\nAnd surprise, are safe when they do things safely.\n\n&gt;The reason they were raped is that circumstances beyond their control put them in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nBeing drunk is beyond your control? Knowing a creepy person that could be a rapist is beyond your control? Being around drunk people or people with power fantasies is beyond your control? All of these things can easily be avoided.\n\n&gt;You can dress conservatively, not drink, not go out, not party, and what life do you have now?\n\nMine. I dress fine (usually in more clothes than most people) because I like the style and don't feel comfortable revealing skin (even though I'm a dude). I don't drink, because I know I have addiction problems and my parents are alcoholics, I also know the other problems. I don't \"go out\" because I find it boring, and there's a high chance of problems. I *do* go out to places I know are enjoyable and safe, like theme parks, little tokyo, museums, etc. I don't party, because it's filled with drunk people and problems and awful music.\n\nYet, my life is great. I've never had any problems. You seem to think that putting yourself in the way of danger is a 'good time' which is the core problem. If you skydive, you should know there's a chance of the parachute not working correctly. And that many people 'lock up' and don't pull the cord. Parachute places know this, and so they try to minimize risk.\n\nYou seem to be saying 'let me do all of this dangerous stuff, and make sure I don't get injured, because I don't want to accept that responsibility'.",

The former is closer to my view. Typically businesses have a similar mindset: minimize risk. Each person has a risk tolerance, and that effects everything they do. My risk tolerance is fairly low, but can be high provided my safety is intact. I realize my tolerance is fairly low compared to most people, but it is what it is. I hold the opinion that whatever it is that is high risk isn't worth possibly dying and not experiencing anything else.\n\nI also tend to work my life around my preferences. Visiting LA is tricky. I typically avoid it, due to having more crime than where I'm used to, but there's a lot of neat stuff there. So I'll go with a group or something, and be sure to stick to more populated areas.\n\nMy roommate, on the other hand has a much higher risk tolerance and will go out and party, sky-dive for fun, not care about any possible danger, etc. And if he gets injured or near death, that's just part of 'life'. I full respect someone's right to do that, but you can't really say it's not their fault if they get injured because of it. Like if you sky-dive and your parachute fails.

Most definitely.\n\n&gt;I wouldn't want to live your life, or be your friend probably\n\nDitto. But it really depends. When I'm with a familiar face, my tolerance is higher. I just try to keep things within my realm of control. Being stuck in a random city with no familiar people, not having any tech, etc. Is not my idea of a good time. Being in a *new* city is fun, but provided I know where I am and what's going on.\n\n&gt;but your life doesn't affect me and it's your right to live it that way\n\nYup, this is generally how I see things.

I might point out it might be a bad idea, but you are free to assess it yourself and make that decision.\n\n&gt;and your view is certainly consistent.\n\nI strive to make it as such. Having consistent views is how you prove you are serious about them, rather than just saying shit. My political views are tied with my 'religious' views, and with my gaming opinions, to what type of music I like, etc. It's all a nice interconnected system. I work hard to keep it that way. Which is why it takes me a bit to form an opinion on something. It's more of fact checking than randomly spitting out an answer.",

That's pretty much it. (edit: Oh, and \"be consistent\").\n\n&gt;People often lay blame on others by saying \"You shouldn't have done XYZ\", and I figured you would be in this group.\n\nNope. I'll say \"XYZ can lead to bad things, but do it if you'd like.\" With the slutty clothing example, you can surely wear it. I got not problems with it. But if it leads to rape, then that's what it leads to. Note that this isn't actually the case (statistics show otherwise). But if skydiving can cause death, and you die, then there's not really much to blame. You knew the risks, or failed to know them. And then you accepted those risks.\n\nIn business, maximizing risks is done as an aggressive strategy that can earn a lot of money, but can sink a business. Minimizing risks is the opposite, less money, but more safe. Which you want is an opinion. But if the max risk people fail, they should've seen it coming and know the risks.\n\n&gt;I've always thought their view was inconsistent, because you could argue them down to \"But you wouldn't just stop driving a car, would you?\" (or similar).\n\nYea, I'm not fond of cars. I don't trust my own driving ability (I get anxiety whenever I'm in the drivers seat), and I pick and choose the people who drive when I ride with them. I typically try to avoid them when possible, opting to walk, and I personally love subways.\n\nBut I *do* know and accept the risks whenever I enter a motorized vehicle. Which is why I put on my seatbelt and do other safety recommended things when I do.\n\nCertainly some of my actions can *seem* inconsistent. But simply because there isn't another option. And I won't be thrilled about it. Alternatively, it might just be that my risk tolerance is a bit higher than what you are used to me having. Some days you feel risky, you know?\n\n&gt;Therefore I found you remarkably consistent in your view when you said that no, you wouldn't. It's of course still a consistent view, but I respect that you think about the social benefit (or lack thereof) before you decide to speak about something.\n\nI try not to advocate something that I myself wouldn't support and follow through with. I'm not saying be vegetarian, because I see plants and animals as equal. I eat both. I wouldn't be opposed to eating a human either (wouldn't want to for other reasons though). But yes, I try to keep my views consistent. To me, having it consistent speaks leagues about your opinion on them. If you are religious, but don't follow the practices, you obviously don't care as much as the guy who does.\n\nI also try not to say things I don't actually think (unless I'm playing devil's advocate). This ensures there's no confusion.\n\n&gt;It was the degree of your low risk threshold that surprised me - it's not fundamentally different than how we all assess risk generally, but I took for granted the willingness to drive, travel, go to a bar, etc. for most adults. Clearly it's not the case for everybody.\n\nFor me it's different. It's not necessarily *low*. But it can be depending not he situation. Walking to class? That's low risk, no problem. Travel? High risk, depending on location. But I love the idea. So I be careful about it. Plan where I'm going, what I'm doing. Be sure to know where to walk, where to get the required things, and so on. Once that's out of the way, I return to my regular assessment and have fun in the new location.\n\nGoing to LA? Be sure to know the way there and back, and be sure to know which routes to walk along to be as safe as possible. Little Tokyo surprised me, seeing as it's a lot less aggressive/la-style than the rest of the place. Which I then figured into future assessments.\n\nAs for bars. I don't like the idea of them in general. I don't like drunk people, I don't like the possibility of problems there (due to drunk people), it's too loud, problems on transportation there and back (how do you drive to and from a bar?), and so on. Going to the pub on campus is fine, seeing as it's still \"school level\" stuff. I don't drink either, to ensure my decisions don't get all messed up. I'm not fond of mind altering anything. So I haven't touched the stuff.\n\nBut yes, I try to stick to what I *actually* like/support/believe/etc. Not just what I think *should* be the case.  Sometimes that causes problems (like lack of being able to get places), but that comes with the views.\n\n&gt;Clearly it's not the case for everybody.\n\nSure, and most people probably have a higher risk tolerance than I do. And *some* people have it *waaaaayyyy* higher. Like people who think it's reasonable to drink a bunch and then drive somewhere. Or not pay attention while they drive. Ooooorrrr head to a sketchy part of town flashing around iPhones and MacBooks.\n\nMy general thoughts are that people can live how they like, but they should be aware of the consequences of living as such. Sure, spend all your cash, don't focus on saving, and raise up a credit card bill. No problem. Just don't complain when you lack money.\n\nBut yes, on the car thing, I don't have a license or own a car. Which sucks sometimes. If I need to go somewhere far, I get a person who I know drives well to drive. Otherwise I use a different mode of transportation (walk, subway, etc).\n\nI think once self-driving cars come out, I'll be more inclined and happy to use a car. Seeing the statistics puts my mind at ease. And on the side you can do things just like on public transportation. Win-Win.",

Why'd the burglar rob the house? Maybe because they're hard into the poverty trap and they couldn't figure out any other way to survive without taking a hit in another major area of their life. Why did the rapist rape that girl? Maybe because he has a tumor surpressing that part of his brain responsible for impulse control and emotion regulation. Why did that husband murder his wife? Maybe she abused him for 10 years or cheated on him.\n\nAnd from there you have to keep going. Why are there people in poverty, what caused that person to be a sociopath, what caused the person to become so selfish and violent and not see any other way to handle the problem? Etc....\n\nHuman behavior is very complex, but in the end we all act to ease our suffering and gain reward. Although people are generally in control of their behavior and the choice to attack is in the hands of the assailant, something in their brain is telling them this is the right move and something the victim did put them in the equation\n\n\nSometimes you're right, the event was absolutely caused by the selfishness of an assailant who enjoys other peoples pain or having power over someone else to hurt them, or who cares more about getting what they want than the effect it has on the other person, but that's a very small percentage of crimes. And the victims aren't random. The reason someone becomes a victim could be based on their choices or circumstances out of their control (like who else was around, or they were wearing a color the attacker hates) but its important to look at what put them in the position to be hurt in the first place as well as what put the other person in the position of attacker. That's basic survival, learning to avoid danger through mistakes, both your own mistakes and other peoples mistakes. Understanding the mistakes of the victim is about preventing becoming a victim yourself, understanding the assailants motives is about preventing others from becoming victims as well. And if we dont try to understand then society is drastically less likely to prevent it from happening again to anyone anywhere and an individual is less likely to avoid danger themselves. \n\nThere is no one single reason anything happens, even if it looks like someone hurt someone else to get something they wanted and didn't need to survive, like in a rape.

That's untrue. The victim is at fault for engaging in risky behavior, sure. They could have *not* been reckless. But fault lies primarily with the assailant, who could have just *not committed a crime*. Fault also lies with authorities, for not keeping the area safe, and probably local legislators for creating conditions that led to that unsafe street in the first place. We could even blame the parents of the assailant for not doing a good job. However, the victim likely has no tangible control over the authorities, the legislators, history, or the assailant.

It's the core foundation of society and what makes it work. You help me, and I'll help you in the future. If I don't help you in the future, that mutual bond is broken, and you no longer help me. And perhaps attack me instead. This risk of no more benefits encourages the repayment. Similar to a loan.\n\nExpand that to a much longer relationship, and bonds strengthen, since you have a solid history of trust.

What would've been irrational was forming the relationship and then *not* building it up. Some people can see the potential in others, which can be beneficial. Along with that, some things which might seem disadvantageous might be a personal preference of the other person. Like shyness.\n\n&gt;she didn't do this because she expected me to help her in return; she did it because she felt hurt to see me suffering.\n\nIf this is true, a common occurrence must be to see your wife drop what she's doing and help out every stranger that she sees suffering. I'm guessing there's other reasons as well, even if this might have been the major factor. Otherwise why not just pick up a bum and help him out? Or three bums?\n\n&gt;she benefitted from this in an extreme way - as we are now married, and now that i'm strong enough to stand on my own, i am able to help her out. but if that were here goal, she wouldn't have taken the risk.\n\nSubconsciously it was the goal. Humans are hardwired to work together. As it's mutually beneficial. Naturally we can override that, but most people follow that wiring.\n\nIf not, perhaps your wife could give me a hand. Haha. Chances are that won't happen, because it's not simply the 'need' that was the attraction.\n\n&gt;i will keep working to help my family members because i love them, even if they don't pay me back.\n\nThere's a few underlying reasons why this might be. Though if you help them, and they keep taking advantage and backstabbing, it's illogical. But as a whole, keeping a lineage is biologically important. It's the same reason most people have the mindset of having kids, regardless of how illogical it might be. Society's overpopulated, kids are expensive and time consuming, etc. The logically better answer would be to not have them. But it depends on what you are going for.\n\n&gt;people who rationally analyze every move and only take choices that benefit them in expected value are not as resilient as people who love each other, because people who love each other will put in more effort to defend their loved ones and get them out of messes.\n\nThis takes the assumption that benefit-driven people don't make mutual social bonds. Which is exactly my definition of 'love'. Unless you can somehow define it without that trait. A strong, long lasting bond of mutual trust is called a \"friend\". A stronger bond, perhaps shorter, but most likely longer, would be 'love' (along with some other opinions/traits you find favorable in a suitable mate).\n\n&gt;the strict rationalists who derive no joy from connection, and only value future gains, will not attract anyone to help them when they need it most.\n\nI fail to see why not. On the outside, a benefit-driven individual would *appear* like any other. Just with different ideologies and motivations. The other non-benefit driven individuals would then see them as equals. And a bond is formed.\n\nAlso note, loans are one such type of impersonal social bond. A person or organization gives you cash, and you are expected to pay it back. Otherwise there are negative repercussions.\n\n&gt;but when you are in a lot of trouble and the odds of you getting out are slim, those who love you are far more likely to take the risk of helping you.\n\nA \"strict rationalist\" (your words) would certainly have individuals who consider themselves 'loved', and would 'love' the rationalist back.  That doesn't change the objective fact of the bond.\n\nIt seems you have the mutually beneficial social bonds I'm talking about, but simply muddy it up with ambiguous language. And perhaps not realize that it's beneficial.\n\nYou also see benefit-driven individuals as \"worse\" or \"lesser\", which is amusing, because most people are benefit-driven. Yourself included.",

Though, given my general behavior and activities, I know fairly well what the risks are and what mistakes I made.

And it bothers me every day. I actually had a superiority complex when I was younger, considering everyone else \"stupid\". I now realize they act on emotion, and not caring to minimize risk. Which I consider stupid, but that's their choice. I still consider them responsible for their actions.\n\nHonestly, objective self-analysis and improvement is the \\#1 thing that should be taught in school. Not history and crap like that.\n\n&gt;you can say this easily, and you may be right. \n\nYup. It's why I'm not afraid to speak my mind and take advice. If I see someone with money, I'm gonna ask them how they got it. What worked for them might work for me too. Same goes for safety and other information.\n\n&gt;if you're a sociopath it's much easier for you to think without being influenced by your emotions.\n\nTIL I'm a sociopath :P. I've actually considered that for a while. But I've found it difficult to self-diagnose, as I don't have a comparison point. 'Regular' people seem to think completely differently than I do, which leads me to think something is off about me. But I can't quite determine what it is. Either way, my opinion still stands.\n\n&gt;for some people, it takes years of effort to think clearly about their pain. if you have too much pain, this just isn't possible.\n\nDepends on what kind it is. Physical pain, I've been in a lot and was fairly fine. I mean, I haven't lost an arm or anything, but I'd imagine I'd get by okay. As far as mental pain, that's much easier. As I've dealt with psychological 'problems' (inconsistency from other people) pretty much my entire life, and I can get over things of that nature fairly easily.\n\nI've also used CBT to remove some phobias and anxiety problems I've had. Why 'normal' people can't seem to do this is beyond me. Do they not care about improving themselves?\n\n&gt;there are lots of people who suffer from this. and yes, it's easy for you to say 'well, too bad, that's your fault' \n\nIt is, really. It's like walking into a grocery store and complaining there's no video games. Duh. You chose to walk into a grocery store instead of a video game store. It's not the grocery store's responsibility to sell games.\n\n&gt;but that isn't really helpful for anyone.\n\nNaturally. Which is why I don't simply say that to people. I typically tell them \"you dun goofed, here's why: X, Y, Z\". Their reception of that information is up to them. I see it as a humane service to provide useful information to those that request it or are in need of it.\n\nIf you have money problems, I'm gonna give you tips. My parents don't talk money to me at all, but I know they are having problems. So I ask what's up, get info, and help them out. In the end I ended up saving them money because they followed my advice. If not, they would've gone with the other choice and spent more money.\n\nI'd naturally give this same advice to anyone else I saw in need. My parents aren't special in that regard.\n\n&gt; i guess if it makes you feel better, go for it. but if you really want to help people, you gotta meet them where they are.\n\nI give useful information. As I said, I try to avoid the 'blame game'. It's futile and pointless. The victim's at as much fault as the perpetrator, but for different reasons. Both can do actions to avoid similar problems in the future.\n\n&gt;if you don't want to help people \n\nI do, which is why I help them think better, more critically, and in terms of self-improvement. Rather than emotionally, playing blame games, and saying 'it's okay, you did nothing wrong!'. Giving them emotional padding simply ignores the problem, rather than fixing it. Which in the long run doesn't help at all besides making someone feel better. Which, IMO, is something they can handle on their own.\n\n\"Hope you feel better\", \"I'm praying for you\", and \"Stay strong!\" aren't helpful. In fact, they are cookie cutter waste of space and time pleasantries that don't mean shit. Just shut up if you aren't going to help. give me stuff I can use.\n\nIf someone's going to feel bad, there's nothing you can say or do that will change their mind. If anything, you can simply make them forget that they felt bad. That doesn't fix the problem at all, it just hides it.\n\n&gt;you're moving into a world where anything a person can do, a robot could do better. \n\nI already think this most of the time and actually opt for the robot solution when possible. Self-checkout, online purchases, etc. The only thing robots can't do right now is creative work. Which is the primary reason I talk to people. To get opinions and creative ideas.\n\n&gt;the only exception wil be 'providing caring human interaction'.\n\nThat too. Though I think we have different definitions. I don't find meaningless pleasantries to be \"caring human interaction\". I see it as a vested interest in a similar or uniquely thinking person which is mutually returned. Or something to that extent.\n\nThat said, I mostly see people as organic robots anyway.\n\n&gt;you might want to rethink that stance.\n\nWhy so? I've found that this 'stance' is the most beneficial to me, and people that I associate with.",

Why 'normal' people can't seem to do this is beyond me. Do they not care about improving themselves?\n\ni did care tremendously about improving myself.  doing this required years of effort, most of which were oriented around understanding my emotions and how they worked. reading the way you write, it seems more likely to me that you are a sociopath, but a genuinely altruistic one.  most people want to improve themselves but don't have the ability you have to suspend or step over emotional thought. \n\nhere's an example: [this picture here makes me cry](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/141lhd/a_north_korean_man_waves_his_hand_as_a_south/) when i think about it too much. it is extremely difficult for me not to think about what both men must feel here when i think about the image.  i thought about it yesterday, and started to become upset. because i'd been doing cbt and meditation for years, i was able to focus on my breath. because i'd put a lot of thought into philosophical/ moral issues, i was able to remind myself that i need to improve my daily life if i want to help others. i was able to remind myself that it's ok to not think about someone else's suffering if it starts to cause me to suffer.  that was hard for me. it's hard to even think about this now.\n\nif you can look at that picture - my guess is that it won't bother you on the same level that it bothers me.  my emotoins are crazy strong for some reason; when i think about someone else's state of mind, it's extremely difficult not to experience that state of mind as well.  it's like - try to imagine the color red without actually seeing an image of something red in your mind. it is difficult for me to imagnie someone else's feelings, without feeling those feelings myself.   that's empathy.\n\nif everyone else seems 'different' from you - it may be that you don't have a lot of empathy. this means you are ideally suited for some tasks, like being a surgeon - you'll have to make objective decisions about things which are painful for most people. empathy can kill you if you're not careful - but it's also what lets us build stable, healthy relationships and lets people feel confident going 'above and beyond' to help strangers.\n\n\n&gt; As I said, I try to avoid the 'blame game'. It's futile and pointless. The victim's at as much fault as the perpetrator, but for different reasons\n\ni think you and i both agree here, often. but what would you say to someone who lost their husband because the police got the wrong address, broke into their house, and shot the man with a baseball bat who grabbed it trying to defend his family?  will that really help the person in their situation?\n\n&gt; I do, which is why I help them think better, more critically, and in terms of self-improvement. Rather than emotionally, playing blame games, and saying 'it's okay, you did nothing wrong!'. Giving them emotional padding simply ignores the problem, rather than fixing it. Which in the long run doesn't help at all besides making someone feel better.

In fact, they are cookie cutter waste of space and time pleasantries that don't mean shit. Just shut up if you aren't going to help. give me stuff I can use.\n\ncritical thinking is important - sure. and just telling someone 'i am praying for you' only solves the emotional consequences of the situation they're in - not the actual problems. the thing is - critical thinking is a very resource intensive process, and is extremely hard to do when you are upset. a little sympathy is often enough to calm a person down enough and make them feel safe enough to engage in that critical thought. \"stay strong!\" by itself is near worthless - i think we agree there. \"stay strong! i'm glad you're ok. here's a list of routes i've found\" is WAY more helpful to most people than \"here is a list of safer places to walk\". you may be an exception yourself. \n\n&gt; Why so?

Given my current experience as the only data point, I must say that they indeed choose to. Perhaps they lack control. Either that, or they function entirely different than me. I actually tackled with solipsism for a while because of this.\n\n&gt;i knew i was acting on emotion, but i wasn't sure what logical system made sense to work with.\n\nI think this is probably the biggest problem. People don't care to improve themselves, and don't know where to begin with objective and critical thinking. Which is why I think classes for it should be required.\n\n&gt;i wanted to be kind and good to people, and i felt shitty when i did anything for myself.\n\nThe two aren't mutually exclusive. Also consider *why* you want to be good to people. I hold the opinion true altruism doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;fixing that required working my way through lots of complicated emotions. if i could have just done it 'instantly' i would have - but that choice wasn't available.\n\nWhich is why it should be taught early, so people don't struggle, and so more people can learn.\n\n&gt;people who understood i was operating on flawed principles were able to help me. people who judged me for operating on flawed principles made me more upset and just made the problem worse.\n\nDefinitely. When I was younger I went through a process of refining my understanding of things. Only more recently did I adjust my core values.\n\n&gt;you may very well be a sociopath. i don't mean this as an insult or slander;\n\nI don't take it as such. If you said it in spite, perhaps. But your tone is neutral and conversational, so I don't think of it as such. Either way, I don't have ill feelings towards the disabled or mentally different.\n\n&gt;if you suspect you are different from most people, i'd suggest that the advice you offer is great for people who are like you, but can hurt people who aren't like you. \n\nTrue, which is why I avoid giving suggestions I would give to myself or someone like me. Either way I try to provide objective information, regardless of how you perceive it. I'll recommend \"bad\" movies, simply because I know the person will like it (even if I don't). Similar idea.\n\n&gt;you haven't really experienced psychological pain, then.\n\nI'd disagree and said that I have. Perhaps it's different than others, but it's definitely there. I remember when I had a breakdown over getting a \"B\" in a class. As I said, I deal with mental problems almost daily, so I'm more than equipped to handle my brain.\n\n&gt;i did care tremendously about improving myself. doing this required years of effort, most of which were oriented around understanding my emotions and how they worked\n\nTook me about a year. Some point during 4th grade until about middle school or so. 4th-5th for covering and having it not effect my actions (with a few slips). Middle school was a lot of grudges and unshown hate. By high school I had that shit down, and didn't worry at all about emotions effecting my actions. During that time I had a lot of fundamental worldview shifts as well.\n\n&gt;reading the way you write, it seems more likely to me that you are a sociopath, but a genuinely altruistic one. \n\nI consider myself to be the opposite of altruistic. I also don't think true altruism exists. I think people function similarly to myself (a natural assumption and an unprovable one), and my worldview has come to accept singular non-timedependent reincarnation. that we are all the same. So I try to help out my fellow humans when possible, expecting they'll return the favor. It also makes things nicer in the long run.\n\nAs for the way I write, I try to stay in a neutral and objective tone. Though  I can get fired up about things I'm passionate about, or when someone is systematically ignoring and trying to uproot a core view when they don't have any particular reason to do so. Like religion.\n\n&gt; this picture here makes me cry when i think about it too much\n\nBesides reflective emotions (which are a cognitive thing I'm aware of), I get nothing from this picture.\n\n&gt;my guess is that it won't bother you on the same level that it bothers me. my emotoins are crazy strong for some reason; \n\nCorrect. Though I find that certain anime bring me to this level. But only specific parts that probably would be 'funny' or not at all important to someone else. It's amusing.\n\n&gt;when i think about someone else's state of mind, it's extremely difficult not to experience that state of mind as well. \n\nAs I said, mirrored/reflective emotions. Mine are mostly muted, but given a similar situation to what I've experienced and mine can flare up.\n\n&gt;it may be that you don't have a lot of empathy. this means you are ideally suited for some tasks, like being a surgeon \n\nNope. I hate high risk situations, and realistic gore makes me queasy. I didn't even like acknowledging that I had a huge gaping gash on my elbow (you could see to the bone) after a electric scooter accident.\n\nAs for the empathy thing, I dunno. Empathy/Sympathy are really meaningless words to me, and I always forget which is which.\n\n&gt;but it's also what lets us build stable, healthy relationships and lets people feel confident going 'above and beyond' to help strangers.\n\nSo in other words you help strangers for absolutely no reason, other than some illogical reason that you aren't sure why you are having? Seems absurd. I help people, but for a very logical reason that makes sense and can be explained to anyone.\n\n&gt;but what would you say to someone who lost their husband because the police got the wrong address, broke into their house, and shot the man with a baseball bat who grabbed it trying to defend his family? will that really help the person in their situation?\n\nYup, not much you could've done to minimize that situation. Similarly when video game streamers get SWATted. It's out of their control. At this point, there's no advice to be given.\n\n&gt;critical thinking is a very resource intensive process, and is extremely hard to do when you are upset.\n\nPeople's lack of critical thinking is what makes me upset. To calm myself down, I must return to my acceptance that people are 'dumb' and don't do the logically obvious thing.\n\nMy cat dying, for instance, would bum me out (I like my cat), but I wouldn't be an emotional train wreck because of it.\n\n&gt;\"stay strong! i'm glad you're ok. here's a list of routes i've found\" is WAY more helpful to most people than \"here is a list of safer places to walk\". you may be an exception yourself.\n\nEither to me is acceptable. I mostly filter out pleasantries anyway. As far as what I'd post, typically a short simple pleasantry (hope you are okay) along with some advice. No advice? No pleasantry.\n\nI also recently found out people don't read through an entire body of text before reacting. I figured it didn't matter and wrote negatives-&gt;positives. They got upset, and I tried to point out the positive part of my comment. No dice. Criticism comes from both what you did wrong *and* what you did right.\n\n&gt;i was suggesting you reconsider was lack of a desire to help people.\n\nI don't though. Yes, I have a lack of desire to help a random stranger when I'm busy. But if I'm just mindlessly heading somewhere (maybe for lunch), I'd help out someone if possible. I see it as contributing to a society where people can act in mutually beneficial ways.\n\n&gt;you just don't seem to value emotional support as a form of help.\n\nCorrect. I don't understand why emotions have a large impact on decision making either. As far as \"emotional support' saying \"I'm praying for you\" means nothing. Seeing as I could've said that to myself. Or simply assumed that they have that feeling in mind. Repetitive comments of the same manner are even more useless. If you gotta say it, just have one person do it. Not 20.\n\n&gt; it seems you may not need it in order to think clearly - but i think most people do.\n\nI'll keep that in mind.",

They elect to get this money through robbery.  If they stake out a specific alley and a victim appears they get money, if no victim appears they leave the alley and find a victim somewhere else.  They need money and they intend to use crime to obtain it, so whether or not you personally are mugged someone is going to be mugged.\n\nHave you ever heard the one about being eaten by a bear?  \"I don't need to be able to outrun the bear - I just need to be able to out run you!\"  Same logic.  You can avoid being robbed but someone is getting robbed whether or not you avoid that specific alley.\n\nStranger rape is a similar issue.  Putting yourself in the mind of the predator when you buy roofies you are planning on raping someone.  If all the girls at the bar are dressed like nuns except one your choice of targets might be influenced but when you bought that pill someone was going to get raped as a result.\n\nMost rape however is not stranger rape (most crime for that matter is not stranger crime), it is someone we are related to either by friendship, blood, or marriage.  In this instance things become almost impossible to pin down from a \"causation\" perspective and, more troubling, any attempt to view these things from a causation perspective leads victims to a horrible amount of internal guilt as, in any relationship with prolonged periods of contact and trust, they have acted in a way that might be interpreted as flirtatious or seductive.\n\nOn your second view: I would argue that since the majority of this type of violence defies causation as it is done by people known/related to the victim if we were to engage in examinations of causation we would be left with a huge group of victims harboring guilt (as is actually the case) and learning very little of any actual utility (i.e. we might be able to identify certain areas in which gangs are active and target them with extra policing - however we already do this without inquiring into how short the rape victim's skirt was).",

These are, at most, correlations (neighborhood is unsafe, cops in that region are corrupt, etc).  The actual _cause_ of being raped/killed is the rapist/bad cop.\n\nNow, there's nothing wrong with addressing the problem and trying to minimize the chances of having bad things happen, but the burden of preventing that situation should never be on the victim.  It seems to me that trying to minimize such chances is something one should do beforehand (i.e. when someone is talking about going somewhere).  After the fact (i.e. when it's being reported), one should be focused on solving the problem and not preventing something that already happened.\n\nOne other problem with focusing of minimizing chances the way you pointed out is that it makes seem like it's being taken for granted.  That is, if the reporter says \"you shouldn't be walking in that neighborhood because it's not safe\" makes it seem like that's the way it is and the population should not expect anything different.",

Discussions deteriorate when the word \"cause\" is used both to mean a necessary and sufficient cause and a conditional with respect to a probabilistic outcome. \n\nThe necessary and sufficient cause of a mugging is that the mugger decided to mug someone, period. But there is a way in which the particular person he choose to victimize served a role by placing themselves in a way as to make them a probable target. This gets expressed as: \"if this victim wasn't walking down the dark alley drunk and alone, then some other person likely would have.\" \n\nThe person being drunk and alone and stumbling down a dark alley did not cause their being made into a victim, the mugger did that. However, the person did provide the conditional requirements necessary to become a victim to that particular mugger at that particular time. They aren't responsible for the mugging, that is for being _a_ victim, but they are responsible for their being _that particular_ victim. \n\nThe problem in discussions like these generally results due to a lack of precision in language.

Like I mentioned in the original post, it's also highly relevant to the issues of police racism and violence against minorities. \n\nMy argument isn't just that explaining causation can help people be safer. My argument is: firstly, explaining causation does not imply justification. I'm not saying anyone deserved what they got - that is how I see victim blaming (though I'm open to other arguments for what constitutes victim blaming). Secondly, explaining causation can be a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, this is the weaker of my arguments; I've already accepted that it's not always worthwhile, and you should reserve this to situations where you have a respectful relationship with the victim. Furthermore, I think you should speak in a way that doesn't impose any blame on the victim (obviously); rather, you say something like: \"I got mugged there too, it's a really unsafe area. I try not to go into that area anymore.\"",

When I was raped by my now ex boyfriend, I blamed myself. \n\nI am an extremely logical person with little by way of pride. I don't usually care to know who is at fault, just to know what factors contributed to the outcome so I can influence a better outcome in the future. This is what I believe you are describing should be harmless.\n\n\nSo after the rape, I asked myself what caused it. At the time, I was struggling with low libido because of stress. It's important to note that I have a serious medical condition related to stress that is thus far a medical mystery: I blackout when I am too physically and/or emotionally stressed in the sense that I can't remember what happened more than five minutes ago, and in extreme cases, I am not able to form sentences or articulate thoughts well at all. When really major things happen when I am blacking out, I do sometimes recall them in a dream-like way. So I spend a lot of my time \"dreaming\", if you will. \n\nAnd so all of this was surely one of the factors, in my opinion. I mean, if someone who is used to sleeping with me regularly, with whom I usually share a bed with naked every evening, does not get to have sex with me for many days in a row, then that would surely increase my chances of getting raped by him (not that it should in an ideal world, but humans are still just animals). So I said to myself that if I was just able to have sex more often then maybe I would have been turned on at that time and wanted to have sex. It didn't feel like I was blaming myself at all at the time because he often would say to me that he was confused if I wanted sex or not if I was partially or completely naked (should have been a red flag). As I said, I don't have a lot of pride, so when I am in my own living space, I am often naked, no matter who is over. Since he told me every day that he loved me, I just had to believe that he just didn't know that I didn't want to have sex at that time. As I said, I couldn't articulate anything and honestly, I thought I had dreamt it until I saw a little blood down there the next morning (probably TMI, but I let other people decide that). \n\nSo I told myself that it was a communication issue and that I need to be more clear when I want to have sex or not. I started changing my behaviors in really subtle ways, like wearing more clothes when he was around or saying outright that I am not in the mood tonight when I get home.\n\nNothing I could do seemed to stop him from coming over and touching me when I didn't want it. I still was having problems with low libido after the rape, and now I had a sub-conscious aversion to him sexually that I didn't immediately recognize. So I started to spend less time with him until I finally broke up with him because I couldn't take the stress of not knowing when I was sending the wrong signals.\n\nSo we try being friends. We are both logical people after all. Then we go on this camping trip with a few people neither of us had met before and a few really good friends of mine. After the trip, he started telling me that the new people hated me and my behavior was atrocious. I blacked out the whole weekend, so I believed him and got really upset with myself. I write this whole long apology to my good friend since I apparently really offended her friend (whom I hadn't met before this weekend), and she says, \"I had completely forgotten that conversation before you just brought it up, it was that unimportant\".\n\nI started to think about my entire relationship with my now ex after that, and when I confronted him, he admitted that he may have been seeing me in poor light because of the break-up. So, that is when I realized what happened this whole time: when my ex was turned on, he viewed all of my behavior as coming on to him sexually. When my libido was high, this was fine, because he'd turn me on and ... When my libido was low, this manifested with him raping me. It came out in this conversation that he knew I didn't want it at the time, and I was really hurt. I don't talk to him anymore, especially because I still love him.\n\nFast forward a few months (about 6), and now I am still feeling the repercussions of what I thought was harmless analysis of \"cause and effect\". I thought I was just being constructive and pro-active about my growth as an individual at the time. The fine line between \"explaining causation\" and blaming someone. I still have the same negative consequences from that experience that I would if I had outright blamed myself. The fact that it was all dressed up as \"this wasn't my fault, but what could I have done differently\" ultimately changed nothing.\n\nI don't trust my current boyfriend not to rape me. I don't like to be naked around him, even when I don't mind being naked around just about anybody else. When I go through periods of low libido, I feel like I owe him sex.\n\nNobody blamed me for the rape. I didn't even think of it as rape until about a month after the conversation where I stopped talking to my ex entirely. I didn't even think it counted because we were dating at the time. \n\nSo you can take this insight for whatever you'd like. If you want to hear what I think about other particular instances, knowing that I have this unique experience to speak from, then I'd be more than willing.\n\nSearching for cause is no different than searching for blame in the end. Both are just ways to live with the consequences. Searching for cause can be constructive, but it can also be destructive, just as blame can. I learned this the hard way and will be dealing with the consequences for a long while to come.",

But because there was someone there going to mug someone, and you happened to be the victim.\n\nJust like if you lived somewhere, and someone broke into your house. Sure, you *chose* to live there, but that doesn't mean you are the reason your was broken into.\n\nThat said, it's still worth noting that a person's actions do affect the overall outcome. Just as non-participant's actions effect the outcome. The question then becomes \"by how much\"?\n\nIn some situations, like muggings and rape, there are definite things you can do to *decrease* the probability of those things happening to you. And since you have a decent degree of control, I'd agree you should work towards the result you want.\n\nDoes that mean it's the victim's fault? Not at all.

            "text": "&gt;What do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection?\n\nTwo answers. #1 rigor and #2 it saves us from reinventing the wheel.\n\nWhen you ask the question of whether philosophy is useful, you give us an example of a practical application of philosophy. We're on the same page there. To expand on that, we face a lot of practical questions about what things have value. When we create school curricula we're making value judgments, when we allot budgets. These are, at least in one facet, philosophical questions, and important ones.\n\nBut you suggest we can answer these questions without studying philosophy. Can we answer high level economic questions without studying economics and math? Can we figure out plumbing questions without training in plumbing?\n\nThese value decisions (and value is just one kind of philosophical question we deal with constantly) can be based on valid or invalid arguments. If no one studies arguments of value, why do you believe that we can naturally recognize these with no study? Why do you think we should start from scratch in all value decisions rather than seeking to understand the work that has been done in the past?\n\nA lot of philosophy seems to be common sense just because it's been so thoroughly integrated into our culture. The place that we're currently at though is the result of a lot of work in ethics, epistemology and metaphysics. To assume we can arrive at the best answers just by thinking hard is ignoring the work that got us where we are, both in failing to understand how much labor was required to get us here, and failing to challenge some of our current baseline.\n\nNot everyone needs to study philosophy for their day to day lives, but everyone consumes it whether they know it or not. If no one studies it, then no one will be able to teach it. If no one is able to teach it, then everyone's philosophical positions will have no rigor, will make no use of the work that has already been done before.\n\nAll our philosophical questions then may as well be answered by /r/showerthoughts or /r/trees. Without rigor and background, that's where introspection gets you.",

i thought the weasel had boxer shorts?' - it does not bode well for your credibility.  the guy who drives the semitruck across the bridge made of dental floss is a mad scientist. the guy who says he could do this if he had a few million dollars is just mad. \n\nimagine a group of people trying to figure out how to get into a cave. there's a door on the cave. it's got some kind of puzzle. there's like 200 people in this group around the door, and they've tried all kinds of things. access to this door is limited, too - only one person can fit in the platform right by the door.\n\nif you show up and say 'hey guys i've been thinking about this thing, what if we tried X' - and they _think_ they tried X a hundred years ago and it didn't work, but they spent about a decade trying it and it got them nowhere - they aren't going to want to listen.  your odds of being listened to go up much higher if you can say 'last time we tried X, we stopped right here because we gave up we believed Y told us X should have worked. that made sense at the time because we didn't know about Z; model Z suggests doing X for just a bit longer might be sufficient, to account for this gap in our understanding of Y' - then they are more likely to listen. if you've been part of the group and talking with them for the past few years, reliably saying things they all seem to agree on - then they are more likely to listen to you. everyone has limited attention; people don't want to waste it. sharing your pet theory is a lot more fun than trying to understand someone else's. \n\nyou have to build credibility within any group. this is a well known fact among most people - and the fact that it's not written down is why so many people won't listen to strangers without social credibility talk about anything. if you haven't been able to pick up the fact that  most people discard the opinions of strangers - especially if they make bold claims - they people figure you must not be that smart about philosophy, either. \n\nif you want to engage productively in this kind of discussion, you must first build credibility and then make your claim in terms of the claims that have already been made. this is not because these claims are assumed to be true; basically all of philosophical history is 'arguments which we don't believe anymore' - they want you to make your claim in terms of past failed claims so that *they know you were paying attention* - because from their perspective, if you weren't paying attention, chances are that you're going to be like the hundred million other guys who showed up with a 'brand new idea' that was proposed centuries ago, and people argued bout for a while, and did find some traction, until someone else poked holes in it and everyone started moving on.",

But what about when you've answered a philosophical question correctly?\n\nEconomics has rigorous mathematical formulations and you can tell when you've calculated correctly by measuring changes in the distribution of resources in the real world.  Philosophy does not even dream of approaching the same level of rigor and has no measurable impact that you can use to determine whether your philosophy is right or wrong.\n\n&gt;refined as any other field, isn't it?\n\nNo.  Philosophy is absolutely not as refined as any other field.

Because you cannot improve them, they remain unrefined.\n\nThe basic cycle of philosophy is, hundreds of years ago, some guy wrote some things.  End of cycle.  Ever after people read that philosopher's works and bicker over the many obvious flaws.  Nothing ever gets refined, because while there is obviously a lot wrong, you cannot satisfactorily pick out what is right and what is wrong.  Later philosophers may publish new versions of older philosophical ideas, but these aren't refined so much as they are mutated.  Refined would mean tested, purified.  Mutated is just changing some old ideas for your own.\n\n&gt;All our philosophical questions then may as well be answered by /r/showerthoughts or /r/trees. \n\nYes, they may as well, because they don't really matter.  What is the meaning of life?  It doesn't matter whether you read Dostoyevsky or the top post on /r/trees.  You are going to have to figure out what your life is about for yourself.\n\nPhilosophy has no verifiable insights about the world.  What is a good life?  The correct system of ethics?  How should we govern?  What is justice?  These are all fundamental philosophical questions, that, despite centuries of effort, are entirely unanswered.\n\nAs a challenge to philosophy: Name the biggest accomplishment in the past ten years for your field.  Fifty?\n\nIt is worth noting that no other field of study would have a second's pause at listing their greatest recent achievement.

Congratulations, you've done it. But what about when you've answered a philosophical question correctly?\n\nPhilosophy, by nature, deals with questions that are at the edge of science and/or of a very different type to the kinds of specific practical solutions to mechanical problems that you're setting it up against here.  The hidden assumption in your argument is that only questions and solutions of this particular sort matter and since philosophy doesn't achieve them (even if it doesn't set out to) then by extension it doesn't matter.  It's a false yardstick.  It's like saying plumbing is useless because it can't tell me if chocolate or strawberry is better.  Plumbing doesn't deal with that type of question.  It's ridiculous to expect it to.  \n\nAnd yet Philosophy absolutely does have a practical impact on our day to day lives.  The very systems of Government we live under have been shaped and moulded by philosophical argument.  The American Republic didn't just arise out of thin air, and it didn't just pop in to the heads of the founding fathers, it was established within the context of a rich historical discussion and debate, a refining of argument and counter-argument, and in particular the work of a philosopher named John Locke.  The concept of human rights, influenced heavily by Imannuel Kant, in education with John Dewey, the separation of church and state, so on and so on, all questions that fundamentally shape and impact the way we see and experience the world we live in and the very types of people that we are.  Hell, we wouldn't have the logic we run our computers on with the work of philosophers.  The scientific method itself!  *You* can afford to dismiss and ignore all of that background, because you are the direct beneficiary of its product.\n\n&gt;The basic cycle of philosophy is, hundreds of years ago, some guy wrote some things. End of cycle. Ever after people read that philosopher's works and bicker over the many obvious flaws...No. Philosophy is absolutely not as refined as any other field. Because you can not test your philosophies, you cannot improve them. Because you cannot improve them, they remain unrefined. \n\nThis kind of comment is frustrating to read because it shows you don't even know what you're dismissing.  You don't seem to have a basic understanding of what philosophy is about or what it does, which means you haven't even bothered to find out.  That makes it hard for me to take you seriously.  There are absolutely methods for determining 'good' and 'bad' philosophy.  Philosophers use logic and reason to differentiate between 'good' philosophy and 'bad' philosophy.  Bad arguments disappear in to the dustbin of history, good arguments hang around and are criticised, and adapted to address those criticism in a kind of intellectual survival of the fittest.  Refined, in other words.  Philosophy makes its own kind of progress, try finding an argument for slavery that hasn't already been systematically demolished, for example.  \n\n&gt;As a challenge to philosophy: Name the biggest accomplishment in the past ten years for your field. Fifty?\nIt is worth noting that no other field of study would have a second's pause at listing their greatest recent achievement.\n\nWhy restrict it to 50 years?  I can name all sorts of accomplishments that philosophy has contributed to throughout history, including in art, in politics, in ethics, in logic.  Furthermore, when a philosophical question becomes amenable to empirical verification, it no longer gets called philosophy, it gets called science, and the very backdrop and context of discussion that helped focus and provide theoretical clarification for the research that eventually becomes science is completely ignored and forgotten.  Einstein, Heisenberg, in physics, read and appreciated philosophy.  It helped shape the way they saw the world, the kinds of questions they asked about it.  There's no shortage of psychologists who were influenced by philosophers, from Piaget to Bowlby, whose theories of development and personality have gone on to be tested and supported empirically, and helped influence the way we talk about raising our children and treating disorders of the mind.  In fact, a great many of those who ended up revolutionising their fields have an appreciation for and a respect of philosophy.  If you look at what's happening in Cognitive Science right now you'll find an entire field as an example in action where philosophy is playing an integral and important role in the development of a new discipline.  Again, *you* can afford to dismiss all of that because the benefits are already there!  You're taking a very narrow view to how human knowledge arises and develops.  It's not all plumbing problems and solutions.",

For example: \"Some of the founding fathers read philosophical books, probably, ergo, philosophy invented America.\"\n\n&gt;The American Republic didn't just arise out of thin air\n\nThe American Republic was founded by experienced statesmen, building off of a long and storied legal tradition.

Such was Locke's influence that Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"Bacon, Locke and Newton... I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences\".[15][16][17]\"] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke)\n\nAgain, astounding willful ignorance.  Lucky for us, Jefferson didn't share it with you.\n\n&gt;Name any thing that philosophy has produced, discovered or invented in the past fifty years.\n\nI just spent a lengthy post outlining the kind of fundamental contributions philosophy makes culturally, both historically and currently.  Again, have a look at the field of cognitive science right now, it's full of philosophers who are helping advance and shape our understanding of the human mind.  I also mentioned John Bowlby and Jean Piaget, two 20th century psychologists who developed hugely influential theories in their field that they have *explicitly stated were influenced by the work of philosophers.*  These aren't just examples of people who \"might have read some philosophy sometime\", these are people that credit philosophers for contributing to and influencing their work *directly*.  I talked about human rights, which have only over the last 50 years been codified in institutions like the UN and which continue to shape us culturally, which have been established, debated, and continue to be debated, *philosophically.*  I mentioned that the logic that powers our computers was developed over centuries by philosophers.  The scientific method itself is the product of philosophy.\n\nI can go on, but is there really any point? \n\nYou want Philosophy to produce specific unequivocal answers to set problems (or to invent things), when as I've explained ad nauseum, by its very nature it doesn't *deal* with questions that *have* specific unequivocal answers (whether because of technological limitations or because they're just different sorts of questions).  That doesn't mean they aren't also important questions and it doesn't mean they don't profoundly shape and affect our world, as I've also explained at great length (with specific examples), and yet you seem unwilling to engage with it.  So at this stage, again, why should I take you seriously?  You're not asking questions and genuinely looking for the answers.  You're starting with the answer and framing loaded questions to arrive back at it.  That's a logical fallacy.  You would get torn apart if you submitted this argument in a first year philosophy class, both in your comprehension of others' points, and in the framing and logic of your own.  You yourself, I suggest, would benefit greatly from a basic introductory course in philosophy.\n\nThe original question wasn't whether philosophy invents things, whether it discovers hard facts about the world, or whether it reaches unequivocal solutions to specific problems.  That's *your* question and as I've explained, it's a poorly framed one that fundamentally misunderstands what philosophy is in the first place.  The original question was whether philosophy has tangible value as an academic field of study.  That's one I feel like I've given a pretty good argument for in the affirmative, and one that you haven't even bothered to begin to address.",

A philosophy major isn't the only way to get these skills, but as an employer I would be expecting philosophy majors to be above average in these capacities.\n\nI also think its interesting that you mentioned computer science, which although it serves as the academic gateway to cushy software engineering jobs, most of *computer science* is super theoretical and abstract and not terribly useful in industry, while there's a boatload of valuable software engineering skills that my CS degree barely mentioned that had to be learned in the field. My point is that for both philosophy and computer science (which have a surprisingly large overlap btw), the degrees have high value as a signaling method to employers, but in both cases the \"skills\" you learn are very abstract and often not immediately practical. The value comes from the empirical fact that these programs have a history of producing smart and capable people.",

This is important, because it signifies that you have been taught not only facts in your discipline but also how to think about the discipline. \n\nI'm getting my PhD in Statistics in a couple of months, and one of the best single classes I ever had was a discussion of what \"probability\" means. As it turns out, that simple point makes up a large part of the difference between the two \"schools\" of statistical thought - frequentists thing it's something that can be hypothetically observed (even if not practically observed to the point where you could get a continuous measurement), bayesians think probability represents the strength of your belief that something will occur. Neither one is wrong, and it's an arcane point if you aren't a statistician, but it's critically important if you're going to be thinking about models and data with regards to probability. \n\nWithout philosophy as an academic discipline in and of itself, it would be a lot harder to build a framework for discussing these types of issues. While I would agree that it's not something that everyone should have to major in, I think that a general philosophy class (if well taught) can do wonders for your ability to argue a point, to understand nuances and shades of meaning, and to think critically about a topic (even a highly theoretical point). \n\nIt may not be relevant to your everyday life to discuss whether the world exists outside of our perception, whether our perception of the world is accurate, and whether there is any meaning to life at all - you still have to make dinner, do laundry, and go to work the next day; that doesn't mean that it isn't important to consider those questions. Doing so led to cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and pragmatic approaches to treating people with depression. Philosophy is just the way we get from one idea to the next - some of these ideas lead to experiments, new innovations, practical knowledge. \n\nAlso, philosophy can be fun... the philosophy club at my university, in the tradition of the ancients, has meetings where they drink and argue until they're too drunk to argue. :)",

There's always talk of 'Big Questions' and 'Deep Problems' or whatnot, and I think that misses the point. Philosophy is a set of methods and concepts that you learn and practice and wield, and those methods and concepts are extremely useful in all sorts of circumstances.\n\nWhat you really learn (or rather, the most practically valuable thing you learn) is to become an *expert* in analytical thinking. That means things like: identifying hidden assumptions in people's reasoning, noticing informal and formal logical fallacies and generating counterexamples, identifying and isolating distinct concepts that people have mistakenly superimposed, assessing things like the knowability or provability of a claim, identifying and avoiding circular reasoning, formulating alternative possible explanations when data underdetermines the given theory and on and on. \n\n&gt;What do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection? \n\nThe problem with thoughtful introspection is that you're vulnerable to your own bias. It's very difficult to poke holes in your own reasoning because you always think you're right. Studying philosophy is an opportunity to practice poking holes in arguments that can be very nuanced and very airtight (you don't get this so much in 1st/2nd year courses), and then have a trained philosopher read and poke holes in your reasoning too. You get to read arguments against other arguments and see how expert thinkers think.\n\n&gt; You don't need to study philosophy to become a capable scientist.\n\nObviously not, you need to study science (though you would be surprised how many leading scientists actively study philosophy). Science is a set of methods and concepts that helps you explore the relationships between things in the world. Philosophy, on the other hand, is a set of methods and concepts that helps you explore *reasoning*. You call on science when you need to answer questions about how the world works, and you call on philosophers when you need to know about how to reason correctly in unfamiliar conceptual territory.\n\nMost people don't need philosophy to tell them what to do on a day-to-day basis, because most people don't encounter important and unfamiliar moral choices on a day-to-day basis. But Hospitals hire philosophers (Bioethicists) to help them decide on policies and decisions that affect people's lives in novel and controversial ways (e.g. stem cells, abortion, the policies for people in vegetative states, etc.). Likewise, most people's lives are sufficiently common and boring that thoughtful introspection will do them just fine; but, for example, cutting edge businesses (e.g. tech or service start-ups) rely on previously untested reasoning, and it can be very useful to have a capable, trained set of eyes on your thought process before you pull the trigger.\n\nTL;DR Philosophy is like the science of reasoning, and it can be very useful when you have to reason in unfamiliar or novel ways, such as new business ideas, medical practices, and even science",

Paradoxically this is arguably a result of the success of science, which was ironically developed by what were previously known as natural philosophers. \n\nIf you want to speak in terms of quantifiable benefits or skills one can derive from the study of philosophy these are not hard to come up with. If, however, you are looking for tangible value in the sense of finite and definite answers to very complex questions, then in many cases philosophy falls short. \n\nUltimately though, I think this approach to a subject like philosophy is misguided -- the subject is essentially about the journey, rather than the *necessarily* the result. Another way to look at it is that philosophy is a sort of *instigator* in that it's about questioning, particularly in terms of *why* and *how* using logical, analytical and discursive language. You could also think about it as *theory of knowledge.* Even if it is difficult to give the subject some sort of applied tangible value, this does not mean it is devoid of value altogether since to say I do not philosophize is essentially akin to saying I do not think or reason about anything of fundamental importance. \n\nI recommend you read through this [site](http://www.uri.edu/personal/szunjic/philos/whystudy.htm), which explains things in a bit more detail.",

If you know philosophy then you know the origin and reasons for your assumptions, and the assumptions of others. This aids in outside-the-box thinking and in preventing making stupid or typical mistakes, and arms you with problem solving.\n\nRacism is an example. Many folks believe today that racism is an inevitable human condition that's always been, unaware of how it originated extremely recently. In other words, if you showed the Ancient Romans the death camps of World War II at the height of their troubles with Judea, they'd consider the 20th Century man a total savage and demon. This is because even in Ancient Rome there were ethnically Italian slaves, and Jews who were Roman citizens. The division was political, which is why they published the idea of conversion and ruled many foreign lands without disenfranchising the local populations. In fact, Rome brought them the polis, or the city, and considered themselves liberators and luminaries. They wouldn't have considered themselves \"ethnically Roman\".\n\nRacism was a result of globalism, missionary work and colonialism, American law (men had rights, so to justify slaves there was an incentive to say that Africans were not fully human, and like a beast of burden), and in the 1930s genetics and statistics were taking off. This is the source of racism, or the unique idea that humans are different \"breeds\" and the \"superman\"--which you wont find in history anywhere else.\n\nThe closest thing to racism in the ancient world was tribalism and nationalism, in which people considered \"their people\" like you might consider your family compared to other families. See Asia. There was pride and conflict and even horror, but ideas like genetic superiority and that other people were an infestation would be unthinkable.\n\nWithout philosophy you don't understand the history of ideas, and so you might be inclined to think your assumptions are yours, a consequence of experience, and quite magical. The final result of this [is very ugly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_realism_%28psychology%29), and less likely if you know the roots of your views and others.",

However, this is obviously foolish because countless geniuses have already made those discoveries; it makes much more sense to learn about what's already been discovered, even if (and especially if) you hope to make new discoveries yourself. And to assume that a person who knows very little about math could come up with those theories is, while strictly theoretically true, practically ridiculous.\n\nThe same goes for philosophy. Sure, you COULD use what you know about the world to independently come up with Wittgenstein's *Tractatus*, but I bet you won't, because to do so requires a monumental amount of existing philosophical knowledge that is impossible to figure out in a lifetime without some prior reference. So for the reason alone that it is virtually impossible to reach high levels of philosophy without first understanding the foundations, studying philosophy is a worthwhile endeavor because it gives the student access to knowledge that would have been highly arcane to them had they not studied the subject.\n\nBut your main argument seems to be that studying philosophy is a waste of time because it has no practical use. For one thing, the assumption that the only reason to study something is to major in that field is highly incorrect. Many people including myself leave college and never once use their major in the real world. Some use college as an opportunity to train for professional skills, others see it as a way to grow themselves as people and learn more about the world in general before getting a job and no longer having the opportunity. Both of these are worthwhile notions, and the very fact that people choose to study philosophy as opposed to more \"useful\" majors is proof that its existence is highly desirable at least to the people who are interested in it.\n\nThe biggest takeaway I get from your post is that you did not study philosophy, and you have somewhat of a misunderstanding of what it is. Many people who have never studied the subject believe to learn philosophy is to sit around shooting the shit about hypothetical questions and hackneyed moral quandaries. In actuality, my philosophical education (I minored in it but took as many classes in it as a major) involved tons of rigorous reading and papers, and included topics like AI theory, nature studies, and tort law. The books are extremely dense and, again, built on the backs of thousands of years of preceding philosophy, making it doubly important to study the subject in order to make that more advanced knowledge accessible.\n\nAt the end of the day, even if you don't buy most of those arguments, the fact remains that philosophy is worthwhile because there are people who see the value in taking it to expand their own horizons as well as change the way they view the world. Simply providing new modes of thought and analysis can alter the way you see everything else in the world, and in that sense, philosophy can actually be more transformative and helpful than any other subject.",

I have a solid argument for why it's ok, as an imaginary policy maker I need a good argument showing I'm wrong.\n\nHell, to take it to extremes I want to own other people as slaves. Why shouldn't I?\n\nThe continued study of philosophy gives more insight and more power to arguments for and against the above arguments.

I'm not arguing that philosophers own these arguments, I am arguing that a philosopher is going to be better educated on past and current arguments and is more able to establish the strength of propositions.\n\nI'll use myself as an example. I entered a debate subreddit a long while ago *thinking* I had good arguments. I found out rather quickly that I was an idiot on philosophical arguments regarding religion. Through reading professionals, taking a university level course in it, and studying older arguments I am now slightly less of an idiot (still not as well informed as many though). The same, I think, can be said for many people in many different arguments. All of the people you know can probably create good sounding arguments, but put them in a room for 20 minutes with an opposing philosopher and they would likely find out that their argument has been done before and has been thoroughly shown to be bad.\n\nSo yes, anyone can make an argument. Not everyone can make a well informed and good quality argument that doesn't have any holes in it. That's where philosophy comes in, they poke holes in each other ideas and improve upon them with the possibility of them having major effects on policy or individuals.\n\nEdit: Not -&gt; now.",

Vigilante violence against people who offend you is.  \n\nConsider that the alternative to free speech is government violently suppressing speech.  In that case, not only do the bullies still get to use violence to suppress the speech which offends them, but now they don't face the consequences of using violence in violation of the social contract.  That seems like a lose-lose to me.",

It doesn't give you consequence-free speech, but rather freedom from being restricted by the government. If you say dumb things and pay a non-governmental price, that has nothing to do with the First Amendment. Once the US government starts restricting some offensive-to-other-cultures speech, you've created a classic slippery slope.\n\nMarc Randazza is a notable First Amendment attorney in Nevada. He discussed a kerfluffe with musings of Rush Limbaugh not too long ago. [This article that he wrote is helpful.](http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/12/opinion/randazza-limbaugh-speech/)\n\nIf something I've said hurts your feelings, then too bad so sad. If I think your religion is a joke, then deal with it. The cure for offensive speech is more speech, not bombings or violence or censorship of the offensive speech.\n\nEdit: Typo",

To advocate for this ideal is to attack the idea of attacking any person expressing their opinion.\n\nAn argument against an opinion where the argument includes shaming, concern trolling, etc. is technically a violation of the ideal of free speech, because the argument is focusing on the person speaking the opinion and not the opinion itself. Now, connotations, cultural norms and any instance where personal views are under discussion unfortunately can make this issue very murky. As such, it is not uncommon to see a retreat to the legal definition. I think this is a mistake, that the only reason the legal version exists is because the ideal has a great deal of value and is worth striving towards in all areas.\n\nYes, there are times when it is reasonable to curtail your opinion or the opinion of someone else because it may be upsetting to another person.

That is, it's controlled by many genes and the combined output of the their collective actions. So basically, you can take two very smart people, breed them, and get a dumbass. The opposite is also true.

This encompasses both the memory capacity to retain training, and obedience. Both are complex and almost certainly can't be reduced to a single gene.

It does this because it cannot do anything else, it is the only truth, and it arises from the necessary logical conditions for existence: if it can survive and breed, it can exist. No more and no less.\n\nAnd we positively cannot say that intellegence is the thing that will let the human race succeed. It is not thenonly thing we need.\n\nWe need empathy.

One disease, on problem they can't solve with their enourmous beaks and fangs, and that species is dead.\n\nIntellegence IS  a powerful tool. But we can use it to odentofy OTHER powerful tools. Like, the ability to work hard, or to co-exist and cooperate in a society. These tools are EQUALLY responsible for the success of humanity. For these reasons, you cannot eliminate any subset of our species arbitrarily. It cannot be determined which traits alone will result in human \"fitness\".

The opposite is also true. It's all very hard to predict, as is the nature of systems biology. \n\nBasically, by removing some people who perform poorly on these tests, we may be unknowingly removing a large portion of the genes which could potentially result in future generations of smarter people. \n\nIt's functionally impossible right now to actually do eugenics properly, even if we wanted to. That may change in the future, by it is currently impractical. \n\nThis also ignores the possibility that some genes which don't currently contribute to intelligence may hold the potential (through subtle mutations) to unlock unsurpassed human intelligence in the future. Remove those genes and you squelch that potential. What we want is enough genetic diversity to allow crazy outliers (think Einstein) to emerge. It doesn't take many of those outliers to change the world and they teach us even more about intelligence. Reduce the genetic diversity, remove the outliers.  \n\nIf you are concerned with increasing human intelligence, eugenics is a shortsighted strategy.

Your proposal would not make us smarter. It would leave us with fewer low-IQ persons, meaning the *average* IQ would be higher. However, this would not increase the *total* number of persons with high-IQs, which I find more important for advancing the human race. In fact, your proposal would *decrease* the total number of high-IQ persons, since high-IQ families would have less children and low-IQ families would be less likely to produce outliers with high IQs.\n\nI believe the total number of high-IQ persons is more important for advancing the human race. The human race is not advanced by the average population. The human race is advanced by the inventions and discoveries of the extremely gifted and creative individuals. It's those rare individual geniuses that create advancements. The average guys  in the lower 90% will, for the most part, have no impact (neither beneficial or detrimental) on the advancement of the human race. *What we need is more geniuses*. Or at least more smart people. Your proposal limits the number of geniuses and smart people. Therefore, your proposal decreases, rather than increases, the advancement of the human race.\n\nEven if your argument was morally and logistically sound, it still would be counter-productive to the goal you want to achieve. A \"better\" goal would be to force super high-IQ families to have more children. By \"better\", I don't mean it's morally or logistically better; just that if it worked in theory, it would at least produce the goal.",

But the thing is, there's so many other things that a human needs to survive that artificially selecting for specific traits like you recommend can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Consider dogs. Many of us regard purebred dogs as the healthier kinds of dogs, and mutts as, well, mutts. But in artificially selecting for specific characteristics, many breeds of dogs are gaining a lot of genetic defects. Each breed comes with a list of potential issues, large dogs get bloat, cocker spaniels have brains too big for their skulls, German shepherds get hip dysplasia, don't even get me started on bulldogs. We've artificially selected for appearance and personality (including traits like intelligence) without considering health.\n\nObviously with humans we wouldn't go that far, but the fact of the matter is, we can't reliably breed out genetic disorders, not without trillions of dollars in effort and research. We just don't have the tech or the infrastructure to decode everyone's genome yet. And even if we could, how should we select? Sickle-cell anemia is a terrible thing for a lot of people in first-world countries. But in malaria infested parts of the world, it gives people increased immunity. So, what do we do with that?\n\nSo, in order for your proposal to work, we need a much better guideline. Not just going for \"intelligence\" (a poorly defined trait, but whatever), but health, drive, success in society, and so on. My question is: aren't we already doing that? In an idealized capitalist society, the harder workers, the smarter engineers, the people that are offering more to society get more money, which allows them a greater chance at raising children who can then raise their own children and spread whatever it is that allowed their parents to be successful. And it's working. Just with intelligence alone, the Flynn effect shows that globally, humanity is getting smarter, or at least is achieving better in standardized IQ tests. We are at the most successful, most powerful, most creative, most intelligent era of the human race. You want to make it better? The answer isn't eugenics. We don't really need it.

            "text": "There are a couple major problems with optimization when it comes to biology and genetics. The first deals with a few factors of evolution that are typically misunderstood.\n\nEvolution does not select for the *best* examples of a given species, but rather eliminates those who cannot (fail to) survive to adulthood or cannot (fail to) secure a mate. Additionally, sufficiently optimized species typically have a great deal of difficulty surviving transitions in their environment as they are optimized to a given environment (many humans would like to make a transition to being a space-faring species). As such, the support of weaker/less intelligent individuals not only does not exactly sacrifice an optimizing agent we used to enjoy, but also could leave us in an evolutionary cul de sac and much more vulnerable to extinction.\n\nThe other major issue is that the interactions amongst genes and between genes and the environment is not nearly so straightforward as introductory biology classes may leave one with the impression of. For instance, conditions like schizophrenia arise from the combination of a number of different genes and there are several combinations that yield similar symptoms. The other effects of each of these individual genes may be positive in their own right. Additionally, the activation of a given gene is dependent on numerous factors, some of them environmental. This means that we cannot conclusively state that we understand the effects of a given gene, at least not with the current limitations on our knowledge in this area.\n\nWhat we are starting to really gain access to is the ability to replicate the effects of a given gene, to either suppress a negative or induce a positive trait. As-needed gene therapy provides a much more robust gene pool should our society ever be placed in evolutionary bottle-neck conditions (such as a highly lethal pandemic) whilst allowing individuals to still optimize themselves to their own preferences and therefore seems an ultimately better course to pursue.",

            "text": "Hey!  This is one of my great ideas that's so crazy it'll never even be discussed.  Seriously, you want to tell americans they have limits on how many kids they can have?  The conservatives will make parallels to China, and the religious will make it they're goal to create an army in retaliation and out of fear.  Hell, they're doing that now without being threatened.  That being said ...\n\nI wouldn't use IQ, it just sucks ... it could also be detrimental.  I think we all know lots of really smart people who are fairly useless, and other dumb people who accomplish all kinds of stuff and are super successful.  The goal should be to create a better society, not just one aspect like intelligence.  So we shouldn't reward intelligence, per se, but ambition and education.  So here's my idea.\n\nEach person is allowed one child.  So every married couple can have two kids.  It's not directly attached to the person though, kind of like a ticket to get cashed in.  So you can sell your ticket if you don't want to have children, or want money for ... whatever.  This obviously benefits the wealthy.  It's supposed to because if a person has more resources they are better suited to take care of more children, financially.  It could also become a thing where kids sell away their reproductive rights and travel, or use it to pay for education, only to do the same with their disposable income when they get older, allowing the next generation to have some disposable income when they have the time and energy to use it.\n\nThe second part is education.  If you graduate college, or a trade school (note that these would have to be properly defined with criteria, so that diploma mills aren't equivalent to real universities), but achieving a higher degree of education or a advanced knowledge of a craft provides you with the ability to earn a better living, and therefore have additional children if you so desire.  Not to mention the major point of this is to make the world a better place, and the more people in your society that have advanced training leads towards a better society.  So obtaining a degree of higher learning would earn you an additional 'ticket'.  Doctoral graduates would be another.\n\nThis creates an interesting dynamic in the society, as those who are permitted to have children won't always have the time to properly raise them, as they have careers and such.  A nearly complete overhaul of our culture would have to take place for this to have a positive result.  We'd have to take a 'it takes a village to raise a child' approach and establish a government provided child care service group to establish programming, employee requirements, pay, increase in taxes, oversight, etc.  This would be combined with an overhaul of the education system to create programs that teach kids things, instead of just testing them constantly.  This is pretty much where the idea falls apart, since this would require a 180 degree priority change of our government from military to education.  Since education is almost entirely funded and run by the states right now ... well, we all know what happens when you try to take a right away from the states.\n\nThe third part is a necessity and the final nail in the coffin as to why nothing like this will happen in my lifetime; mandatory birth control.  It would have to be for either all women not currently trying to get pregnant, or everyone.  (It won't work with guys only because of rape and other sexual crimes.  There's already an issue with girls since they all hit puberty at different times, and birth control for a 13 year old might not be good for her, medically)  This is where my idea completely collapses and where I stopped thinking about it.  When does someone get to have their child?  So now the government tells you when you're ready to be a parent?  What happens to the 1% of the times that the birth control doesn't work?  Even if it's less than 1%, birth control isn't perfect, so it's going to happen.  And it gets worse when you try to figure out how to even execute this plan ... we can't reach everyone now-a-days to give away free condoms and clean needles, you want to get these people into a real clinc, to have a real procedure, that the probably don't' even want?  And then we have immigrants, legal and illegal.  What about refuges, like we're seeing now, what do we do with them?  I mean, this is a heavy regulation ... and the world is a fluid, war torn place.\n\nLike I said, this is where things collapsed.  A barrage of other problems arise, to me it proved that until we have a government system that actually works with the people's best interests in mind, this sort of thing would only make things worse.  Mainly because it gives additional power and control to people who shouldn't have it, and they'll do what they do best, manipulate people with speeches for their benefit.  What are the reasons behind this?  What about other genetic flaws?  Auto-immune diseases, Cancers, heart disease ... hell even bad eyesight is genetic.  If an argument is made that raising the average intelligence of the populace would be beneficial, so much that we can institute regulations on your ability to reproduce (considered by most to be a basic human right), then I can make an equally powerful argument against most any genetic trait.  As long as I can show one trait, or attribute is better than the other; then the topic gets pushed into a grey area and a person's individual priorities and opinions would have a heavy influence on their views.  Imagine trying to have this conversation with a christian zealot who wants to kill all non-baptists, because they're all going to hell and it's our duty to fix god's world by eliminating this genetic flaw.  (I know it's not genetic, but you'll never convince them of that)\n\nThe better path currently is a worldwide emphasis on education, skepticism and rational thinking.  Some people are dumb, and some people are smart ... but 90% of the world can learn.  An educated populace who's goal is to make a better world, instead of protect what's mine, would probably solve a shit ton of problems in the world over 2-3 generations.  However, solving the problems means distributing power, and those in charge like the current imbalance so they fight against their citizens having knowledge and the ability to communicate.  The extreme ends are the Nordic countries where access to the internet, education, and proper health care is considered a basic human right ... and North Korea, which is basically a country sized prison.  Those in charge have to be willing to give up some of their power for the betterment of the people, the country and the world.  Even in the US we saw the 'No child left behind' legislation pass.  Although this is a simplistic view of the bill, the result seems to have made the entire country less educated.  By making sure no child was left behind, we slowed down the entire class to the learning capabilities of the dumbest kid (or the kid who simply doesn't care).  So instead of the genius kid building a model rocket from pop bottle in 8th grade, they're reviewing basic arithmetic ... again.",

Eugenics makes the assumption that we know which genes are good and which genes are bad, and by maximizing the \"good\" genes and minimizing the \"bad\" genes, our society will be vastly better off.  On the surface, this seems like a good idea - eliminating cystic fibrosis or Lou Gehrig's disease from the gene pool by preventing people with these genes from breeding would strengthen the human race, right?  Except in the past few decades, advances in cystic fibrosis treatment have many people suffering from CF a near-normal life expectancy, and some people with Lou Gehrig's disease (I'm looking at you Stephen Hawking) have still managed to be some of the most influential minds of our generation.  \n\nI'm reminded of a story I was told in college about a young girl who had been diagnosed with late-stage rabies (which is pretty much always fatal when its caught so late).  Doctors were trying crazy treatments, like drastically lowering her body temperature to slow down the infection, in a last-ditch effort to save the girl.  Miraculously, she ended up surviving.  As doctors tried to figure out what they did to save the girl, they eventually discovered that she had a special mutation that essentially made her immune to rabies - while she was certainly sick, she was one of the very, very few people carrying the right gene that made rabies about as dangerous as the cold.  She may have had the highest IQ on earth, she may have had down syndrome.  But its feasible to think of a situation where her anti-rabies gene could make her genetic makeup crucial to \"making the human race more likely to advance and survive.\"\n\nTL;DR  Its very dangerous to start calling certain genes \"good\" and other genes \"bad.\"  Environment combines with genes to make a person who they are, and we're ultimately better off as a species if we have the largest gene pool possible.",

I think that movie shows an almost perfect implementation of ethical eugenics. You don't need to limit the number of children people have when you can make sure make sure their children will turn out good at the moment of conception. Even stupid people can have smart children with genetic counseling at conception. Make sure everyone gets a free genetic consultation and offer to correct any identifiable genetic diseases and you have ethical eugenics.

So you aren't forcing other people not to breed, you've just got your cult of the most highly trained, most intelligent people and you are controlling their breeding over a long period of time, and you've come up with an easy way to measure intelligence. But then along comes this random person who has this other ability you didn't think you needed- say you started your breeding cult on Reddit today, so you picked all people who are great at STEM and educated all your children and grandchildren to place a higher value on those types of talents. Then along comes this other culture with some ability you didn't think was important to survival, and they decide they don't like you because you're a bunch of control freaks who think they are better than everyone else, and they wreck your shit up, and you have no defense against that because you bred out all the people with strong abilities that could have helped because they weren't conducive to the STEM mindset of your culture.",

It would still be false to say that nobody ever changes their view, though. People have deltas awarded to them, and those signify that somewhere out there, somebodies mind was changed. Maybe it was insignificant, maybe it was only changed for a brief moment before some argument changed it back. Regardless, people do change their views here sometimes, and that's a result of them taking the time to examine their views in light of others'. I view that as intrinsically good, the search for knowledge and the refinement of your own belief system, these things make you a better, more educated and well-rounded person. \n\nYou said it was a waste of time because most people's views aren't changed, or aren't changed enough, but I wouldn't say that makes it a waste of time. The mere act of getting someone to evaluate their own views and challenge them is a good thing to get in the habit of. You have to start somewhere, so to speak. Even if it's about the most insignificant of things, or even if they didn't change their mind at all, it's still a positive step for that person to try.\n\nSecond, it sometimes goes the other way. Just because OP doesn't change his mind doesn't mean someone reading the comments hasn't. I've read several posts where I went in disagreeing with OP, but after reading the arguments in favor of their arguments, I've come out with a different point of view. I had no part in the discussion, no comments were made, no deltas awarded, but someone's view was changed.\n\nMaybe it feels like slogging through shit sometimes, but if you can get someone to think critically about their own beliefs even for a second, isn't that a good thing?",

I think it's kind of fun trying to change someone's opinion on a matter, especially if they're really stubborn about it. I know it's futile most of the time (e.g. arguing with my grandma about politics), but there's always something you can take away from any argument, even if neither of you are convinced of the other person's side. You might be able to refine your own criticisms of an idea or acquaint yourself with some argument against your view you haven't heard before. At the very least, you get practice dealing with stubbornness and stupidity, and that's good practice because there's clearly no shortage of those two attributes among people. \n\nIf you only think it's worth it if you convince OP of your view, you're right, it's sometimes just a waste of time.

When most people lose an argument in the way that arguing with grandma can be considered a loss, they come away as frustrated, and even further attached to their opinions. Why? Because they feel as if they are talking to a wall, a stupid wall that cannot grasp the intelligence of the thought. This is why voters have a low turnout rate and every text post on /r/politics approaches maximum characters. People feel that it is harder to get into the minds of the others, and so, they respond by increasing the length, intensity of rhetoric, vocabulary, facts, etc., to the point that /r/politics text posts cannot even be considered to be true because they are so editorialized.\n\nThe idea here is the same.

It has been well thought out and edited and considered at length: the internet commenter is strength in numbers, and that is all.\n\nI would fundamentally disagree here.  First: plenty of books are not well thought out, and while standards are certainly higher than internet comments they can contain their fair share of issues.  Secondly, as you briefly mentioned yourself, it can be extremely difficult for someone who has only been exposed to a single view to actually know how and where to look for opposing viewpoints, thus allowing other people to present these is beneficial.  Finally, I disagree that reading a book is as effective at altering a viewpoint as an actual discussion.  Why?\n\nWhen reading a book it is incredibly easy to simply look at the ideas and dismiss them as \"wrong\".  I already addressed this, but look at it in contrast to a discussion.  A book demands no response, the reader is free to simply skim over it.  Thus, if someone wants their viewpoint changed through a book they must constantly remind themselves not to just dismiss it.  In contrast, a discussion demands a response.  While it is certainly possible that people ignore the arguments and simply restate their points (as you stated), the form of the information means that they have to give it *more* consideration because they have to respond/refute it in some way.\n\nIn essence, I would argue that nothing is really great at changing viewpoints, but discussions are inherently better at reminding people that they *want* to change, and forcing thought processes that are more likely to cause a change in opinion.\n\n&gt;An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.\n\nMy argument is that it is entirely possible that these people *are* seeking to educate themselves, *do* know about other sources, but also mnow that just observing opposing viewpoints will never be enough to actually change their opinion.

I suppose I was approaching it more from the perspective of niche views where searching for the alternative isn't likely to return anything; in retrospect this doesn't fit the common aspect that you desired.\n\nHowever, I would like to offer an additional point: if someone has not been succesfully swayed by any of the sources they have read, if all of the common arguments have \"failed\", then it becomes increasingly difficult to find different and novel arguments that might sway their view.  CMV offers a platform where, due to the many people involved, these novel arguments are more likely to emerge, sheerly through statistics. \n\n&gt;If you are reading the book to have your opinion changed, then you will not simply dismiss everything in it. If you do, you are just wasting your own time.\n\nI would argue that this is a subconscious process.  Our schema causes us to inherently reject ideas contrary to what we believe.  It is quite easy to slip back into this state of rejecting opposing ideas when all you're doing is reading and you're not forced to either formulate an opposition or accept the counterpoint.\n\n&gt;And if such a person exists that does this, that dismisses a book, which devotes pages to arguing a single idea, he will gain nothing from an internet comment.\n\nI will argue, again, that it is not about the content or depth of discussion, which is undeniably better in most books, but rather the form that it takes that allows an internet comment to change views differently, possibly more effectively.\n\nOur ultimate disagreement seems to boil down to the fact that you see books as having superior content and depth, with which I would agree, but you do not believe that the differences in form can allow discussions to be more effective at changing views.

It is quite easy to slip back into this state of rejecting opposing ideas when all you're doing is reading and you're not forced to either formulate an opposition or accept the counterpoint.\n\nWhen we read things that could potentially fundamentally shift our world-view, even in a discussion, this type of thing is easily disregarded. In a reddit discussion, a person would simply not reply again: in a human conversation, a person could shut down his ears. It is not preventable in any medium, and thus takes an intelligent person, that realizes that he could be wrong, to hold an open mind, because it does requires a decent amount of mental willpower. I think we agree on this.\n\n&gt; the differences in form can allow discussions to be more effective at changing views.\n\nPeople learn in different ways: perhaps a discussion would be better. But the hive mind is historically terrible at argumentation. A person is easily overwhelmed by arguing with 20 different people, and could withdraw because he feels that he is being attacked on all sides.\n\n&gt; you do not think demanding a response forces more thought and consideration\n\nDon't think about elephants. It is impossible to obey this command. In the same way, simply reading a book puts the ideas into one's head, and elicits a response there. A person that rejects this can easily reject an internet comment by simply not replying and attacking a different argument in which he feels more safe in his correctness.",

But, like I've said repeatedly, I'm looking specifically at the form it takes.\n\n&gt;A reasonable person that read the book carefully and at least considered all its points, and still walked away believing in himself, will not seek any other source to change his mind.\n\nWhy not?  I would say that we should always be seeking information to either further support our ideas or to contrast them.  It's the only way we can further approach the \"Truth\".\n\n&gt;I actually read a book about how the hive mind is inferior to the singular thoughtful person or collaborative group:\n\nThis goes against what my gut would say, but if it seems to be a substantually supported position then I guess I would concede that looking at books would provide more unique arguments.\n\n\n&gt;In a reddit discussion, a person would simply not reply again: in a human conversation, a person could shut down his ears.\n\nHmm.  Perhaps you and I just function fundamentally differently then.  When I'm reading a book I frequently find myself just absorbing ideas without critically analyzing it.  Obviously this isn't inherent to books, it's just how I tend to interract with that medium.  Conversely, in a discussion I'm always evaluating in my mind, deciding whether I agree or disagree and how to form my counterpoint.  Frequently in the process of forming my counterpoint I'll think of multiple counterpoints to what I was about to say, in the process refining my view and progressing much further than just a book would make me.  Statistically I would assume there are other people like me, and thus posts where arguments could be easily found online *can* be valuable, and *are* a geniune attempt from some people to change their minds.\n\n&gt;A person is easily overwhelmed by arguing with 20 different people, and could withdraw because he feels that he is being attacked on all sides.\n\nWell that sounds like a problem with CMV and not necessarily the people who want their views changed.\n\nOur disagreement seems to be based on the fact that we seem to process information from different sources differently.

An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.\n\nAssuming the poster had the skill to Google what he was looking for in the first place (some don't), there's one problem - they need to make a huge effort to *continue* googling. It's all too easy to find one or two links which provide either neutral or positive points to your opinion. It's also too easy to cherrypick your searches *just* to include those points, or to do other mental gymnastics to avoid the fact that they may be wrong. If nobody is watching, it's surprisingly easy to say \"no, I don't believe that.\" and dismiss it without formulating an argument against it.\n\nBut a CMV is different, it's an arena. OP has no control over the data given to him, and it's very curated data with ELI5-style text around it. There's no search term fudging, not nearly so much ability to dismiss data that disagrees, and the points being made might be things that you hadn't thought to google at all. But best of all, it's made out directly to OP. These people are challenging an OP directly, not just passively throwing links around. It's a hugely different mindset than combing through search results.\n\n&gt;it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.\n\nI disagree. I find that most people have completely changed their minds on most all issues over time. But the key is that it's not like a boxing match; nobody made a knock-out argument that forced their opponent to sit in stunned silence until they admit they're wrong. Instead, most opinions are changed by being seeded by doubt - doubt that grows and becomes very uncomfortable until the person finds themselves arguing in favor of that doubt ( and against their original view). There's no moment in which a person's mind is changed, it's a process. A journey. And the seeds of that doubt could very easily come from a CMV.\n\nI agree with you that being open-minded is difficult. It takes constant vigilance. But It's not binary, it's a continuum. It may take someone all their life to change their view, but it still happens.",

You may have sources, you may have examples, you may have diagrams.\n\nIn a classroom, you have people. You have discussions. You can ask questions. It's an interactive experience that is customized to the people involved. The knowledge comes to you.\n\nAlso, depending on the subject matter, it can be extremely difficult to get some education.

Where are your sources for the claim that most people that post are uneducated? I've seen some fascinating discussions here and some posts that couldn't have been written by an uneducated person. Also, what is your definition of uneducated? \n\nI agree that most people here don't want their opinion changed. I posted once and went into it fully determined there was no way my opinion would be changed. Lo and behold, not half an hour later I gave away a delta. And I think that happens a lot, even if some people aren't familiar with the delta system so they admit you changed their view, but don't actually award a delta. \n\n&gt; it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. \n\nI disagree. I am knowledgeable in some areas, but I'm definitely a very opinionated person. I can honestly say that this sub is godsend for me. It is, without a doubt, my favorite sub here. Why? Because I love discussing things, especially controversial ones. I love debating and I do really like the challenge of changing one's opinion. \n\nI am currently involved in a CMV that has been going on for a week now. A whole week the OP and I have been going back and forth on a topic of their choosing, neither of us budging, but both (if I may say so myself) presenting their cases in an eloquent and smart way. I haven't been successful in changing their view or getting a delta, but I think this sub goes beyond that. My eyes have been opened to the way the OP lives his life and sees certain things, even if he's on the complete opposite side of me when it comes to it. And that's an enriching experience. \n\n&gt; For every stupid person that posts on this sub to address one point of their lack of knowledge, there are foreseeably dozens more points of misunderstanding that remain. What is the overall aim of this subreddit? To educate one at a time, indeed.\n\nI can honestly say that educating people here is secondary to me; it's an afterthought. Yes, it's nice to know I've opened someone's eyes to something and that I've given them a piece of knowledge, but this sub mainly serves as a form of mental exercise to me. I'm practicing in expressing my views in a well thought-out manner, I'm learning how to support my claims with arguments, I'm learning about diversity and respecting other-people's opinions. Everything else is a bonus. \n\nI see this sub as a vessel through which *I do something for myself* while you see it as something where *you do something for others* (mainly trying to educate stupid people in vain, if I'm getting it correctly). \n\nLastly (I have to run now, hopefully we can continue later), why isn't this enough for you? Why is getting a delta more important than bettering yourself in a smart and challenging way? \n\nAlso, yes, you may say that the original idea of the sub was to have people come in with an open mind and even a wish to have their opinion changed, but...the original idea behind upvotes and downvotes was much different than what it is today as well. Doesn't mean the whole experience is lessened by it. It can still be worth a lot.",

I often find myself telling a person the correct answer to a question based on truth that I know, and that person argues against me. My field of expertise tends to be psychology and the theories of what powers the mind. This is a difficult subject for everyone, but it is frustrating to inform a person of the correct, factual answer as accepted by the scientific community to their question, and be rejected because they cannot understand it. That person is uneducated, and additionally, has failed to seek out answers to their question before posting here.\n\n&gt; I do something for myself while you see it as something where you do something for others\n\nAgain, very fair point.\n\n&gt; Why is getting a delta more important than bettering yourself in a smart and challenging way?\n\nI often comment when I have a direct, factual answer to the question. When these answers are rejected, it is not that I am wrong, or the issue is controversial and has multiple facets that are each correct. It is that the other person either cannot accept, is unwilling to accept or is not intelligent enough to accept the true statements and answers that I have provided. It is not about the deltas, per se: I should be awarded a delta because I provided the correct answer, but it is more about the frustration of *not* getting the delta because the person cannot understand or comprehend the answer.",

But the point of Reddit and these subs is to get engage the community, let the knowledgeable ones share their knowledge (and show off a bit, let's be real) and let others learn (especially those who wouldn't have ever thought to be curious about this certain thing in the first place). \n\nSee, I generally go into the more opinion-based threads, both for the challenge and to make up for the fact that there aren't that many topics out there where I can claim to be an expert. And yes, I've posted hard facts and got dismissed. I've also had OPs tell me point blank that I changed part of their opinion or that they see my point and still not get a delta. Some of them don't get the rules of the sub, others just forget or are assholes. Even in your reply to me, in two different places you acknowledged my point and it's clear you see where I'm coming from. Did you give me a delta? I'm not fishing for one, I'm just making a point. You yourself did the very thing you complain about others doing. \n\nAnd on the whole topic of deltas and stuff, I think objectively we should all agree that they don't matter that much. That what truly matters is we put ourselves out there, shared something we wanted to and moved on. But we're human and we like deltas, upvotes and gold because we like feeling validated and we like it when people agree with us. No point in lying about it; I'll be the first to say that I get a bit giddy every time a post of mine gets a few upvotes and that it upsets me at least a little bit when I get downvoted. It's how it goes. And I know it's only worse when it happens when I'm right. \n\nBut I also think there's more to it than this. That 160K people subbed for a reason and that people who post every day and engage others in some very smart discussion (most of the time) are most definitely not wasting their time.",

There is a lot of judgment involved - when to change lanes, when to turn, how to turn to park without hitting the cars in between the space, knowing you can kill someone.  A misjudgment can cause an accident.  You were turning right, you didn't see the person crossing the street, you hit them, they're dead.  There's also the matter of what a car CAN DO.  We all know it's a weapon that kills.  I think that's stuck in the back of your mind, but you can't kill someone with your body when walking.  Technically yes, if you're a murderer, but the regular person can't kill someone walking, but they sure can do that by driving.\n\nBut walking, you're just chilling.  What responsibility is there?  You're just walking.  You can't exactly kill someone by walking, even if you run full speed at them.  If you look both ways, cross the street, and still get hit, it wasn't your fault.  You aren't responsible for anything, at least none that I can think of.\n\nSo I'm guessing you don't like all the responsibility that comes with driving, especially when you say so many small actions can lead to disaster.",

I'm weird like that.\n\nPlanning is something I over-think, admittedly, and this wasn't well-worded; So, when there are a lot of steps involved in something, the wider your time margins need to be, realistically. If I'm driving, I might run into some traffic, but usually I can rely on my time to the office being ~30-40 minutes. Taking 3 different vehicles to get to work on public transit, means 3x more chance for something to go wrong and delays to happen. I could go early, but that's what I'm trying to avoid...\n\nSo, yes, it's possible, but I don't believe that there are as many risks as you think, so it doesn't seem desirable.",

But the ultimate solution to the problem is not scientific.\n\nThe only way it can seem to you that physics can solve free will completely on its own is if you make philosophical assumptions and ignore all criticism.\n\n&gt;The fact that we feel we make choices does not mean that we do.\n\nWhat does it mean, to \"feel we make choices\"?\n\n&gt;Free will means that given the exact same circumstances and experiences, something else could have happened than what did.\n\nIt doesn't mean that. In fact it's more complicated than that.\n\nStill, I can tell you that this particular condition *is* fulfilled. I *could* go for a glass of water. What makes it not actually the case is that I choose not to. The choice is ultimately a physical process, but that doesn't mean it's not a choice.",

Well, I agree with you. But, I disagree that this lack of **eternal** meaningfulness is \"irrational\" or \"depressing.\"\n\nI'll give you an example. A lot of people enjoy spending a large amount of time and energy into their fitness. I'd say the vast majority of these people do not create any real economic benefit to their livelihood (in terms of making money, paying for food, rent) and, should they stop for a year or a month, much of the progress they make will be lost. Most of them will never fully utilize their fitness in a meaningful way. In the long run, their progress will definitely be lost because their bodies will eventually fail, and they will die. Yet, knowing they can't keep their fitness in a single lifetime (let alone eternity), they strive to work out and build themselves. Why is that? \n\n&gt;Every day is a journey, and the journey itself is home\n\n~Matsuo Basho\n\nAs mortal beings, we are relatively short-sighted. But, maybe that isn't a depressing idea. Maybe it's a great thing. Maybe it's beautiful that we can find so much meaning, so many experiences and so much emotion in such a short time frame, even if none of it lasts. Individually, we'll live and die and the universe won't even have had a chance to blink. And yet, maybe we'll get to have lived pretty well here.",

You would eventually become so disconnected from the world. Even if all of humanity was immortal with you, you would only ever be living with a memory of, say, the last 100 years (i mean, maybe, 1000, but even if you could remember a trillion years, that won't matter in a quadrillion years).

Even if you realize your effective memory, you are doomed to limited knowledge. And you can't escape it. When I think about immortality, I am not sure that I want it. \n\nThe only way that immortality would be meaningful is if we can keep some of the past memories indefinitely. Unfortunately, in our universe, this isn't possible. \n\nI don't know quite how to end this, because it can be taken two ways: both immortality and mortality are equally depressing.

Life isn't about being the best, it's about other people as much as yourself. \n\nSpace is limitless. If we play our cards right and put our minds together we could exist forever, we could form colonies on different planets far away from our galaxy, so that when our galaxy dies we will live on in distant galaxies. Many of us won't be scientists but that doesn't make our lives worthless. Think millennia back when there were less than a million people on the planet, the concept that many of them would end up being the ancestor to a very important historical figure must have seemed impossible yet that is what must have happened. If some ancient man and woman hadn't had a kid then that kid wouldn't have had a kid, and then follow that bloodline all the way down to someone great like Einstein. If even one of those people had decided to give up on life and not have sex with the person he/she liked Einstein would never have existed. You might say there would have been another Einstein, and you're right there probably would have been but imagine everyone gave up, suddenly the chance of an Einstein ever existing is dropping to zero. Then we never advance and we never get off our planet or even have a basic grasp on the science we think is simple stuff nowadays. \n\nNow maybe you'd think 'OK so I'm here to influence future generations so that we can hopefully live forever in distant worlds, who cares? There's billions of us, I'm hardly unique'. You are right you aren't unique, but you are incredibly rare. I'm sure you've seen the image of our solar system where the Earth is just a pixel on the screen, life only exists on that one pixel, the rest of the solar system is barren nothingness, spread every human out across our solar system and we could all comfortably live in our own floating space mansions with acres of garden because there are so few of us compared to the vast universe we live in. Hell the stars far outnumber us yet all of us humans have the potential to do far more in our lifetime than a random star will ever have in it's thousands of years of life. \n\nEven if you choose not to have a child you could still influence someone's life, if you show malice to people maybe you drive a man to depression. Show him compassion maybe he decides there is good in the world and he goes on to contribute to science or to become a great musician that inspires thousands of others, or maybe he just becomes a great father that raises a great kid that goes on to do great things. \n\nHundreds of people you show compassion to probably won't even register it, but that doesn't matter, if even one person takes on board a good action that you've done and becomes a better person for it (and trust me, even if you don't ever know about it, it will happen) then you have contributed to humanity's future advancement and possible immortality. We won't get to see it but does that really matter? We weren't made to live forever even if we could be in the future, we were made to take joy from the little things and I honestly believe that is an evolutionary trait. If we didn't take joy in the little things then humanity long ago would have said 'what's the point?' given up, and died out. Instead we take pleasure from silly things like a 2 minute song that gets stuck in our head, or a person that says 'have a nice day', and that gives us the motivation to carry on and be productive, contributing to humankind's future advancement. We are part of the largest team effort in the world, whether we know it or not every positive action we make is working towards building a better world for future generations, it could be 2000 actions from now where something important happened, but you could unwittingly be the start of that 2000 action chain that leads to greatness with something as simple as a hello.",

            "text": "Scientist here. Life is precious. And I would like to quote Laplace by saying, \"I had no need of that [god] hypothesis\" to say so. I have not only learned about how it works, i've actually made models describing tiny pieces of it. And the insights they have gained me go far beyond what i observed in my plots, or my equations, or even my explanations. Being immersed in science and the mathematical and computer modeling of nature, and in particular of life, have given me a very special outlook on it. An outlook i try to share with anyone who cares to listen.\n\nI slowly built up this outlook by taking physical chemistry 1  and 2 (thermodynamics and kinetics), genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, metabolic biochemistry and learning/teaching myself statistical mechanics and mathematical physics and dynamical systems.\n\nI realised quite some time ago that life is just probability. Life is a whole bunch of different systems working because of two things: sheer numbers and affinity. Which become probabilities. That's all it is.\n\nLife is a fight against equilibrium. One system pushes in one direction, which causes another to push back in a feedback loop. If you look at it closely, there is no conscious thought, just probability. Item A is created by item B and destroyed by item C. So the more there is of B, the more we create of A; while the more there is of C, the more we destroy A. Each interaction (creation or annihilation) has its associated energy, which sort of 'weights' the probability of an event. It may be that destruction of A by C is so favourable that for every C to destroy A, you'd need 100 B's just to make up the loss in A's. Now imagine this using all the alphabets on earth and make it non-linear (not always in the same proportion), add feedback loops at various stages and cross link interactions from all over the map. This is life.\n\nWe're also organic computers. Our brains actually work just like traditional computers, only we don't use electrons. We use ions--both positive and negative--and molecules to relay messages from neuron to neuron. But we also use different types of positive and negative ions and molecules, Ca^2+ , K^+ , Na^+ , glutamate, dopamine, serotonine, GABA and many more. And it's all about effectively dispersing energy in different ways.\n\nI already mentioned there is no conscious process involved in any of this equilibration interplay. But what makes life truly precious is that it is more than the sum of its parts. \n\nI have seen this in my short exposure to science, and the research i did over the summer. Especially the research i did during the summer. It was on mathematically and computationally modelling interacting [kinesin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesin) movements along [microtubules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule). The simulation was a couple of *very* simple movement rules, with interaction energies (think of the weights i talked about in the section about items A, B and C earlier) set up in a realistic way. There were also entrance and exit parameters. This very simple abstraction of a biological 1D (1 dimension) system (movement is only in one axis, and in this case only 1 direction) presented very weird behaviours. I also helped develop a mathematical theory to approximate these findings, and that was *extremely hard*, and not completely right. This deceptively simple system gave me further evidence that life is fucking precious. But i didn't stop there. I made more codes (but not more theories) for increasingly complex systems, which kept being 1D but presented other interactions, and some the possibility of movement in the backwards direction. They all behaved in different and increasingly more complex ways, presenting strange shapes and behaviours, all in 1 dimension. Yet they are still highly simplified abstractions of a tiny little part of a huge whole we call life.\n\nAs my career as a scientist moves forward, as i learn more about the simulation of nature via mathematics and programming, i confirm what i have thought for as long as i remember having the power of thought. That nature is fucking awesome, weird, complicated, exciting, scary, or whatever adjective you may ascribe to it; but most of all, that its crowning jewel--life--is precious. Precious not because it was created by a god, which has been proven to not have been necessary by the de-novo and 'environmental' (from scratch) synthesis of aminoacids, lipids, liposomes, XNAs, and self-assembling molecules in-lab and the discovery of aminoacids, lipids, and complex organic molecules in space. Precious not because i, or anybody else says so. But precious because of how unlikely, delicate and mind-boggingly complex it all is, more than anything else out there, because it actually involves or interacts with everything else out there.",

Consider the quote:\n\n\"The journey itself to the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"\n\nNow I wont get too much into the story behind this, but this is a quote from Albert Camus, he actually shared your perspective, but extrapolated something very different. \n\nSisyphus is a character is Greek mythology, he was a King, a rather despotic leader actually. One day he disobeyed the Gods, and so as punishment, they made him push a boulder to the top of a hill, and when he got to the top, allow it to roll back down to the bottom. Making all his work pointless. This, Camus thought, was analogous to our lives, everything you do will amount to nothing.\n\nHowever, as the quote would explain, Camus thinks that the fact that we exist, however meaningless this may seem at first, gives us purpose. That purpose? To simply lead a virtuous and enjoyable life. This can seem quite paradoxical at first, a way to think about it would be when Satre said \"existence predates essence\", Camus would agree, but would go on to say that existence creates a somewhat artificial essence in and of itself. \n\nWhile this may not change your view, maybe I have even supported it, but you must understand this is not a depressing view at all. Rather it is a liberating one. I would strongly suggest reading the book by Camus, \"The myth of Sisyphus\", of which that quote is the last line of. Satre is also a badass, if you wanna check his stuff out, I would recommend \"Existentialism is a humanism\".",

It matters to OTHERS how old you are when you die. If you were to drop dead now, your parents (assuming they are alive), your friends, and those close to you in general will be pained by this. Your loved ones will experience pain if you died at 100 years old, but your children, grandchildren, and maybe great grandchildren will have lost something precious to them.\n\n&gt; I might as well have never lived. \n\nPeople have had an influence on you, and you will have had an influence on others. Consider people like Isaac Newton, Einstein, Richard Dawkins, George Washington, Abe Lincoln, Nicola Tesla, Alan Turing, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Elvis. This is a short list of people mixing those some alive today and some dead. But they all had a huge impact on us today. They are all remembered. And for a very long time, they will all be remembered. Yes, eventually the DNA you pass to your descendents will be so diluted it will be unrecognizable. But that does not mean that the contributions you made to others' lives have all been meaningless.\n\nYou won't know what you did for others, but they will know what you did for them. Think about a lesson a dead loved one taught you. Do you REALLY think it is meaningless because that person does not know how it impacted you?\n\n&gt;  Assuming there is no afterlife, life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die. Death is the great eraser.\n\nI think that if we consider a worldview in which there is no afterlife (a worldview which I do share with you), it makes life itself more meaningful. Imagine for a second that there IS an eternal afterlife. Human average lifespan is approximately 80 years. Compared to ETERNITY, that is nothing. Imagine an electron located at the center of the universe. Every second, that electron moves the distance of one electron towards one \"edge\" of the universe (which is expanding). That electron's goal is to reach one end of the universe and then turn around and go to the opposite edge. Assuming expansion is faster than size of one electron per second, that is eternity. That is how long it will take to complete that cycle. It does not end. Any period of time you consider is as meaningful as one yoctosecond (10^-24) when there is an eternity. When we have such limited time to live and be with our loved ones, everything we do is meaningful. Every second we do not love our loved ones is a waste.\n\nThink about what is needed for an afterlife view, ESPECIALLY with the Judeo-Christian view: that sort of worldview says there is love more important than the love that your REAL friends and your REAL family, who choose to spend their limited time with you. Those who love you here in this life will die. Yes. But the limited time you have to love your family and friends is more than enough. \n\nIf we are looking from the religious viewpoint on a meaning of life then yes, in a sense an atheistic view of life does not have an overall meaning. But you can give it your own meaning. You said in a different comment that you want the moments with your girlfriend and with reddit to last forever. It won't, but you sure as fuck can make all the best of the time you DO have. Everyone wants something impossible at some point. But as nonreligious people (in this case I just include you and me, but I suppose others can feel this way as well), we have to settle for what we have, or perhaps for what we CAN have. To paraphrase one of my professors from last semester, you have to live so that you will be able to die tomorrow and say that life was worth having lived. You can't have the impossible but you CAN make sure that what you had is enough.",

I would read business books and other types of useful non fiction. At first I used to think that reading these books would get me into consulting or to continue an academic career in business. But as the years went by and I had forged myself a different career, I kept reading.\n\nAnd when you read books en mass you don't memorise every details. It is not exactly like the example where you forget a book, but later you don't remember it as fully as when you are reading it.\n\nAnyway, today I am nearing my 100th book and I am think should I keep reading? I work in software and these business books are not exactly in my field, most of the time they are not very useful to what I do and I might not end up using them in the future (although I have some hope, but let's put this aside).\n\nWell many ideas have come to mind about why I should continue reading. One was to write something. Another was to make better intelligent conversation with people. But mostly, the best thing about reading these books is the experience I have while reading them. I might not be working in business or consulting, but during the time I read those books, I have the experience of being immersed in a world of business and academia. \n\nAnd this is how one should see life. If life is going to end, that doesn’t mean that the enjoyment one gets from living is meaningless or useless. The meaning of the here and now is what is experienced in the here and now. When we die if we don’t continue so what? We are dead, but we made the best of our lives and that’s in itself is meaning.",

In a metaphysical sense you could argue that we essentially never exist. This of course is assuming that death is an elimination of existence which is beyond what anybody truly knows. It is a bit depressing but can also be quite liberating as you can free yourself from society's many irrational norms and expectations.\n\nAs for things having meaning, from this standpoint you can create your own meaning. May as well enjoy life while you temporarily exist.\n\nYour bleak view reminds me of the Queen line from Bohemian Rhapsody, \"I don't wanna die. I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.\" Never being born is essentially the same as being dead, you just never have the conscious mind to experience the fear of contemplating it. I guess it comes down to what you think is worse. Never experiencing life or living in fear of death.",

If it makes you feel any better, at the time I had this realization I would have terrible panic attacks thinking about it. It would usually be while laying in my bed thinking at night but it eventually got bad enough that these panic attacks would hit me even while in class in high school. I couldn't go an hour without the thought crossing my mind. At the time it seemed like the most horrible outcome possible. That nothing I did mattered because it would all be wiped out once I was gone was a miserable thought. Since then I wouldn't say that I've entirely come to terms with it but I don't see it as all that terrible anymore. I forget who the philosopher was but he said something about how the fear of death is irrational because even if there is nothing after life you cannot feel the fear of death once you are dead. I do like how it has changed my view on life though. It is easier to identify what is really important in my life and I don't concern myself with petty things that many people stress over in their daily lives.\n\nA friend of mine passed a few weeks ago and I found myself wondering if from his perspective I ever existed. I like to at least pretend I do.",

Getting depressed because you aren't the exception to this rule is really rather arrogant. Why can things only have meaning if they exist for eternity? Why must you, personally, witness events for them to matter? \n\nYou also seem to be ignoring the effect your life can have on others. Take [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip). He was an unexceptional man, a nobody, who through a very unlikely coincidence set in motion events that would shape the entire 20th century. That's obviously an extreme example, but it illustrates my point: our choices can impact others even after we're no longer around to see it. Doesn't that mean a life has meaning?",
