\section{Abstract}
\textbf{Motivation:} In an era of widespread misinformation, the task of fact verification—determining whether a given claim is supported, refuted, or lacks sufficient evidence—has become increasingly important. We aim to improve the reasoning and expressive capabilities of language models by simulating argumentative discussions before making a final judgment.\\\\
\textbf{Research Question:} Can a simulated debate between two model-based agents—one supporting the claim and one refuting it—lead to more accurate fact verification compared to a single-step decision?\\\\
\textbf{Data:} We will use the FEVER \cite{FEVER} benchmark dataset, which provides claims, gold-standard evidence, and labels (SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NOT ENOUGH INFO). For fine-tuning, we will use data from Reddit’s r/ChangeMyView (CMV) \cite{winarg} forum, which contains rich argumentative discussions well-suited to enhancing a model’s reasoning ability.\\\\
\textbf{Model:} We will fine-tune a language model (Flan-T5-large \cite{t5}) on the CMV data. During inference, the model will simulate a debate between two agents: one consistently arguing that the evidence supports the claim, and the other that it refutes the claim. This debate will then be used as a prompt for the same model to generate the final prediction.\\\\
\textbf{Evaluation:} We will evaluate the model using accuracy on the FEVER test set, comparing performance with and without the debate phase to assess the impact of the simulated discourse.\\\\
\textbf{Milestone:} We will evaluate the performance of the baseline model before the fine-tuning, on the test set (FEVER dataset).\\\\
