# Research Project Guidelines - Advanced Natural Language Processing Course

## General Information

**Weight in final grade:** 60% of the total grade  
**Working groups:** Three students per group  
**Estimated workload:** 20-30 hours per student  
**Submission deadline:** July 31st

Each project will be defined as one of the following categories:

1. **Data Collection**

3. **Evaluation Method Development**
4. **Analysis of Existing Tools**

## Submission Deadline

**Final submission:** July 31st

## Submission Requirements

The project will include two mandatory components:

### 1. Research Summary Report

#### Report Structure:
- **Up to three pages of text** describing the project
- **One or two paragraphs** on research limitations and potential ethical implications (not counted as part of the three pages)

#### Recommended sections in the report:
- Introduction and motivation
- Problem description
- Solution/approach description
- Experiment design
- Results
- Analysis
- Summary

#### Additional materials allowed:
- Unlimited pages of images/tables/graphs
- Unlimited pages of citations

**⚠️ Important:** Reports longer than three pages of text will not be read!

### 2. Code on GitHub

- Link to code on GitHub platform
- Code will include a README file describing the code in general
- Detailed instructions for reproducing the results in the paper

## Grading Criteria

- **The grade is not determined by model success**, but by the quality of work
- **A project that meets its goals will guarantee a grade of 80**
- **A project that does things beyond the goals** will receive a grade higher than 80, depending on the quality and complexity of additions
- **A small number of projects** will receive a very high grade (95)
- **A very small number of outstanding projects** (e.g., close to something publishable) will receive a grade above 95

**Note:** It's likely there won't be more than 2-3 such projects - we hope to be pleasantly surprised!

## Important Notes

- **Uncoordinated delays** in submitting materials for meetings during the semester will result in point deductions
- Must adhere to the timeline and come prepared to each meeting
- The project must be original and demonstrate independent work by the group
